Today, we begin our exploration of machine learning operations (MLOps). Before diving in, we need to ensure a basic
understanding of several key topics that we'll use throughout the course. This session focuses on setting up a suitable
development environment. Many of you likely have prior experience with these topics, so this will primarily serve as a
review.

We're starting here because many students lack fundamental skills that are often assumed but not explicitly taught. This
session covers the essential skills to begin your MLOps journey. For a broader overview of computer science
fundamentals, we recommend [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) from MIT.

!!! tip "Learning objectives"
