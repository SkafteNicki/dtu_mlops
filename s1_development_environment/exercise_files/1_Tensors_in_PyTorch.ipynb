    "# Introduction to Deep Learning with PyTorch\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, you will get an introduction to [PyTorch](http://pytorch.org/), which is a framework for building and training neural networks (NN). ``PyTorch`` in a lot of ways behaves like the arrays you know and love from Numpy. These Numpy arrays, after all, are just *tensors*. PyTorch takes these tensors and makes it simple to move them to GPUs for the faster processing needed when training neural networks. It also provides a module that automatically calculates gradients (for backpropagation!) and another module specifically for building neural networks. All together, PyTorch ends up being more coherent with **Python** and the ``Numpy/Scipy`` stack compared to *TensorFlow* and other frameworks.\n",

    "Deep Learning is based on [artificial neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network) which have been around in some form since the late 1950s. The networks are built from individual parts approximating neurons, typically called units or simply \"neurons.\" Each unit has some number of weighted inputs. These weighted inputs are summed together (a linear combination) then passed through an activation function to get the unit's output.\n",

A vector is a 1-dimensional tensor, a matrix is a 2-dimensional tensor, an array with three indices is a 3-dimensional tensor (RGB color images for example). The fundamental data structure for neural networks are tensors and PyTorch (as well as pretty much every other deep learning framework) is built around tensors.\n",

Remember that for matrix multiplications, the number of columns in the first tensor must equal to the number of rows in the second tensor. Both `features` and `weights` have the same shape, `(1, 5)`. This means we need to change the shape of `weights` to get the matrix multiplication to work.\n",

However, if the new shape results in fewer elements than the original tensor, some elements will be removed from the tensor (but not from memory).

Here I should note that the underscore at the end of the method denotes that this method is performed **in-place**.
