# Requests and APIs

---

!!! info "Core Module"

Before we can get deployment of our models we need to understand concepts such as APIs and requests. The core reason
for this is that we need a new abstraction layer on top of our applications that are not Python-specific. While Python
is the defacto language for machine learning, we cannot expect everybody else to use it and in particular, we cannot
expect network protocols (both locally and external) to be able to communicate with our Python programs out of the box.
For this reason, we need to understand requests, in particular HTTP requests and how to create APIs that can interact
with those requests.

## Requests

When we are talking about requests, we are essentially talking about the communication method used in client-server
types of architectures. As shown in the image below, in this architecture, the client (user) is going to send
*requests* to a server (our machine learning application) and the server will give a *response*. For example, the user
may send a request to get the class of a specific image, which our application will do and then send back the
response in terms of a label.

</figure>

The common way of sending requests is called HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). It is essentially a specification
of the intermediary transportation method between the client and server. An HTTP request essentially consists of two
parts:

* A request URL: the location of the server we want to send our request to
* A request Method: describing what action we want to perform on the server

The common request methods are (case sensitive):

* GET: get data from the server
* POST/PUT: send data to the server
* DELETE: delete data on the server

You can read more about the different methods [here](https://dev.to/adidoshi/http-request-methods-16ik). For most
machine learning applications, GET and POST are the core methods to remember. Additionally, if you want to read more
about HTTP in general we highly recommend that you go over this [comic strip](https://howhttps.works/) protocol, but
the TLDR is that it provides privacy, integrity and identification over the web.

### ‚ùî Exercises

We are going to do a couple of exercises on sending requests using
[requests package](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) to get familiar with the syntax.

1. Start by installing the `requests`` package

    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```

2. Afterwards, create a small script and try to execute the code

    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.github.com/this-api-should-not-exist')
    print(response.status_code)
    ```

    As you can see from the syntax, we are sending a request using the GET method. This code should return status
    code 404. Take a look at [this page](https://restfulapi.net/http-status-codes/) that contains a list of status
    codes. Next, let's call a page that exists

    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://api.github.com')
    print(response.status_code)
    ```

    What is the status code now and what does it mean? Status codes are important when you have an application that is
    interacting with a server and wants to make sure that it does not fail, which can be done with simple `if`
    statements on the status codes

    ```python
    if response.status_code == 200:
        print('Success!')
    elif response.status_code == 404:
        print('Not Found.')
    ```

3. Next, try to call the following

    ```python
    response=requests.get("https://api.github.com/repos/SkafteNicki/dtu_mlops")
    ```

    which gives back a *payload*. Essentially, payload refers to any additional data that is sent from the
    client to the server or vice-versa. Try looking at the `response.content` attribute. What is the type of this
    attribute?

4. You should hopefully observe that the `.content` attribute is of type `bytes`. It is important to note that this is
    the standard way of sending payloads to encode them into `byte` objects. To get a more human-readable version of
    the response, we can convert it to [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) format

    ```python
    response.json()
    ```

    Important to remember that a JSON object in Python is just a nested dictionary if you ever want to iterate over the
    object in some way.

5. When we use the GET method we can additionally provide a `params` argument, that specifies what we want the server
    to send back for a specific request URL:

    ```python
    response = requests.get(
        'https://api.github.com/search/repositories',
        params={'q': 'requests+language:python'},
    )
    ```

    Before looking at `response.json()` can you explain what the code does? You can try looking at this
    [page](https://docs.github.com/en/rest/search?apiVersion=2022-11-28) for help.

6. Sometimes the content of a page cannot be converted into JSON, because as already stated data is sent as bytes.
    Say that we want to download an image, which we can do in the following way

    ```python
    import requests
    response = requests.get('https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/making_progress.png')
    ```

    Try calling `response.json()`, what happens? Next, try calling `response.content`. To get the result in this
    case we would need to convert from bytes to an image:

    ```python
    with open(r'img.png','wb') as f:
        f.write(response.content)
    ```

7. The `get` method is the most useful method because it allows us to get data from the server. However, as stated in
    the beginning multiple request methods exist, for example, the POST method for sending data to the server. Try
    executing:

    ```python
    pload = {'username':'Olivia','password':'123'}
    response = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data = pload)
    ```

    Investigate the response (this is an artificial example because we do not control the server).

8. Finally, we should also know that requests can be sent directly from the command line using the `curl` command.
    Sometimes it is easier to send a request directly from the terminal and sometimes it is easier to do it from a
    script.

    1. Make sure you have `curl` installed, or else find instruction on installing it. To check call `curl -`-help` with
        the documentation on curl.

    2. To execute `requests.get('https://api.github.com')` using curl we would simply do

        ```bash
        curl -X GET "https://api.github.com"
        curl -X GET -I "https://api.github.com" # if you want the status code
        ```

        Try it yourself.

    3. Try to redo some of the exercises yourself using `curl`.

That ends the intro session on `requests`. Do not worry if you are still not completely comfortable with sending
requests, we are going to return to how we do it in practice when we have created our API. If you want to
learn more about the `requests` package you can check out [this tutorial](https://realpython.com/python-requests/) and
if you want to see more examples of how to use `curl` you can check out
[this page](https://gist.github.com/subfuzion/08c5d85437d5d4f00e58)

## Creating APIs

Requests are all about being on the client side of our client-server architecture. We are now going to move on to the
server side where we will be learning about writing the APIs that requests can interact with. An application programming
interface (API) is essentially the way for the developer (you) tells a user how to use the application that you have
created. The API is an abstraction layer that allows the user to interact with our application in the way we want them
to interact with it, without the user even having to look at the code.

We can take the API from GitHub as an example <https://api.github.com>. This API allows any user to retrieve, integrate
and send data to GitHub without ever having to visit their webpage. The API exposes multiple endpoints that have various
functions:

* <https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/branches>: check out the branches on a given repository
* <https://api.github.com/search/code>: search through GitHub for repositories
* <https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows>: check the status of workflows for a given repository

and we could go on. However, there may be functionality that GitHub is not interested in users having access to and
they may therefore choose not to have endpoints for specific features (1).
{ .annotate }

1. :man_raising_hand: Many companies provide public APIs to interact with their services/data. For a general list of
    public APIs you can check out this [page](https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis). For the Danes out there, you
    can check out [this list](https://github.com/mauran/API-Danmark) of public and private APIs from Danish companies and
    organizations.

The particular kind of API we are going to work with is called REST API (or RESTful API). The REST API specify specific
constraints that a particular API needs to fulfill to be considered RESTful. You can read more about what the six
guiding principles behind REST API [on this page](https://restfulapi.net/) but one of the most important to have in
mind is that the client-server architecture needs to be stateless. This means that whenever a request is send to the
server it needs to be self-contained (all information included) and the server cannot rely on any previously stored
information from previous requests.

To implement APIs in practice we are going to use [FastAPI](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/). FastAPI is a
*modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints*.
FastAPI is only one of many frameworks for defining APIs, however, compared to other frameworks such as
[Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) and [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) it offers a sweet
spot of being flexible enough to do what you want without having many additional (unnecessary) features.

### ‚ùî Exercises

The exercises below are a condensed version of [this](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/) and
[this](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/) tutorial. If you ever need context for the exercises, we can recommend
trying to go through these. Additionally, we also provide
[this solution file](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/dtu_mlops/tree/main/s7_deployment/exercise_files/fastapi.py) that
you can look through for help.

1. Install FastAPI

    ```bash
    pip install fastapi
    ```

    This contains the functions, modules, and variables we are going to need to define our interface.

2. Additionally, also install `uvicorn` which is a package for defining low level server applications.

    ```bash
    pip install uvicorn[standard]
    ```

3. Start by defining a small application like this in a file called `main.py`:

    ```python
    from fastapi import FastAPI
    app = FastAPI()

    @app.get("/")
    def read_root():
        return {"Hello": "World"}

    @app.get("/items/{item_id}")
    def read_item(item_id: int):
        return {"item_id": item_id}
    ```

    Importantly here is the use of the `@app.get` decorator. What could this decorator refer to? Explain what the two
    functions are probably doing.

4. Next lets launch our app. Since we called our script `main.py` and we inside the script initialized our API with
    `app = FastAPI`, our application that we want to deploy can be referenced by `main:app`:

    ```bash
    uvicorn --reload --port 8000 main:app
    ```

    this will launch a server at this page: `http://localhost:8000/`. As you will hopefully see, this page will return
    the content of the `root` function, like the image below. Remember to also check the output in your terminal as that
    will give info on when and how your application is being invoked.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Image](../figures/fastapi_request.PNG){ width="1000" }
    </figure>

    1. What webpage should you open to get the server to return `1`?

    2. Also checkout the pages: `http://localhost:8000/docs` and `http://localhost:8000/redoc`. What does
        these pages show?

    3. The power of the `docs` and `redoc` pages is that they allow you to easily test your application with their
        simple UI. As shown in the image below, simply open the endpoint you want to test, click the `Try it out`
        button, input any values and execute it. It will return both the corresponding `curl` command for invoking
        your endpoint, the corresponding URL and response of you application. Try it out.

        <figure markdown>
        ![Image](../figures/fastapi.PNG){ width="800" }
        </figure>

    4. You can also checkout `http://localhost:8000/openapi.json` to check out the schema that is generated
        which essentially is a `json` file containing the overall specifications of your program.

    5. Try to access `http://localhost:8000/items/foo`, what happens in this case? When you specify types in your API,
        FastAPI will automatically do type validation using [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/), making sure users
        can only access your API with the correct types. Therefore, remember to include types in your applications!

5. With the fundamentals in place let's configure it a bit more:

    1. Lets start by changing the root function to include a bit more info. In particular we are also interested in
        returning the status code so the end user can easily read that. Default status codes are included in the
        [http](https://docs.python.org/3/library/http.html) built-in Python package:

        ```python
        from http import HTTPStatus

        @app.get("/")
        def root():
            """ Health check."""
            response = {
                "message": HTTPStatus.OK.phrase,
                "status-code": HTTPStatus.OK,
            }
            return response
        ```

        try to reload the app and see what is returned now. You should not have to re-launch the app because we
        initialized the app with the `--reload` argument.

    2. When we decorate our functions with `@app.get("/items/{item_id}")`, `item_id` is in the case what we call a
        *path parameters* because it is a parameter that is directly included in the path of our endpoint. We have
        already seen how we can restrict a path to a single type, but what if we want to restrict it to specific values?
        This is often the case if we are working with parameters of type `str`. In this case we would need to define a
        `enum`:

        ```python
        from enum import Enum
        class ItemEnum(Enum):
            alexnet = "alexnet"
            resnet = "resnet"
            lenet = "lenet"

        @app.get("/restric_items/{item_id}")
        def read_item(item_id: ItemEnum):
            return {"item_id": item_id}
        ```

        Add this API, reload and execute both a valid parameter and a non-valid parameter.

    3. In contrast to path parameters we have query parameters. In the requests exercises we saw an example of this
        where we were calling <https://api.github.com/search/code> with the query `'q': 'requests+language:python'`.
        Any parameter in FastAPI that is not a path parameter, will be considered a query parameter:

        ```python
        @app.get("/query_items")
        def read_item(item_id: int):
            return {"item_id": item_id}
        ```

        Add this API, reload and figure out how to pass in a query parameter.

    4. We have until now worked with the `.get` method, but lets also see an example of the `.post` method. As already
        described the POST request method is used for uploading data to the server. Here is a simple app that saves
        username and password in a database (please never implement this in real life like this):

        ```python

        database = {'username': [ ], 'password': [ ]}

        @app.post("/login/")
        def login(username: str, password: str):
            username_db = database['username']
            password_db = database['password']
            if username not in username_db and password not in password_db:
                with open('database.csv', "a") as file:
                    file.write(f"{username}, {password} \n")
                username_db.append(username)
                password_db.append(password)
            return "login saved"

        ```

        Make sure you understand what the function does and then try to execute it a couple of times to see your
        database updating. It is important to note that we sometimes in the following exercises use the `.get` method
        and sometimes the `.post` method. For our usage it does not really matter.

6. We are now moving on to figuring out how to provide different standard inputs like text, images, json to our APIs. It
    is important that you try out each example yourself and in particular you look at the `curl` commands that are
    necessary to invoke each application.

    1. Here is a small application, that takes a single text input

        ```python
        @app.get("/text_model/")
        def contains_email(data: str):
            regex = r'\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\b'
            response = {
                "input": data,
                "message": HTTPStatus.OK.phrase,
                "status-code": HTTPStatus.OK,
                "is_email": re.fullmatch(regex, data) is not None
            }
            return response
        ```

        What does the application do? Try it out yourself

    2. Let's say we wanted to extend the application to check for a specific email domain, either `gmail` or `hotmail`.
        Assume that we want to feed this into our application as a `json` object e.g.

        ```json
        {
            "email": "mlops@gmail.com",
            "domain_match": "gmail"
        }
        ```

        Figure out how to alter the `data` parameter such that it takes in the `json` object and make sure to extend the
        application to check if the email and domain also match. Hint: take a look at
        [this page](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/body/)

    3. Let's move on to an application that requires a file input:

        ```python
        from fastapi import UploadFile, File
        from typing import Optional

        @app.post("/cv_model/")
        async def cv_model(data: UploadFile = File(...)):
            with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as image:
                content = await data.read()
                image.write(content)
                image.close()

            response = {
                "input": data,
                "message": HTTPStatus.OK.phrase,
                "status-code": HTTPStatus.OK,
            }
            return response
        ```

        A couple of new things are going on here: we use the specialized `UploadFile` and `File` bodies in our input
        definition. Additionally, we added the `async`/`await` keywords. Figure out what everything does and try to run
        the application (you can use any image file you like).

    4. The above application actually does not do anything. Let's add [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/)
        as a package and let's resize the image. It can be done with the following three lines:

        ```python
        import cv2
        img = cv2.imread("image.jpg")
        res = cv2.resize(img, (h, w))
        ```

        Figure out where to add them in the application and additionally add `h` and `w` as **optional** parameters,
        with a default value of 28. Try running the application where you specify everything and one more time where
        you leave out `h` and `w`.

    5. Finally, let's also figure out how to return a file from our application. You will need to add the following
        lines:

        ```python
        from fastapi.responses import FileResponse
        cv2.imwrite('image_resize.jpg', res)
        FileResponse('image_resize.jpg')
        ```

        Figure out where to add them to the code and try running the application one more time to see that you get a
        file back with the resized image.

7. A common pattern in most applications is that we want some code to run on startup and some code to run on shutdown.
    FastAPI allows us to do this by controlling the *lifespan* of our application. This is done by implementing the
    `lifespan` function. Look at the [documentation](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/events/) for lifespan events
    and implement a small application that prints `Hello` on startup and `Goodbye` on shutdown.

    ??? success "Solution"

        Here is a simple example that will print `Hello` on startup and `Goodbye` on shutdown.

        ```python
        from contextlib import asynccontextmanager
        from fastapi import FastAPI

        @asynccontextmanager
        async def lifespan(app: FastAPI):
            print("Hello")
            yield
            print("Goodbye")

        app = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)

        @app.get("/")
        def read_root():
            return {"Hello": "World"}
        ```

8. Let's try to figure out how to use FastAPI in a Machine learning context. Below is a script that downloads
    a `VisionEncoderDecoder` from
    [huggingface](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/vision-encoder-decoder#transformers.VisionEncoderDecoderModel)
    . The model can be used to create captions for a given image. Thus calling

    ```python
    predict_step(['s7_deployment/exercise_files/my_cat.jpg'])
    ```

    returns a list of strings like `['a cat laying on a couch with a stuffed animal']` (try this yourself). Create a
    FastAPI application that can do inference using this model e.g. it should take in an image, preferably some optional
    hyperparameters (like `max_length`) and should return a string (or list of strings) containing the generated
    caption.

    !!! example "simple ML application"

        ```python
        from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer
        import torch
        from PIL import Image

        model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
        feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")
        tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning")

        device = torch.device("cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu")
        model.to(device)

        gen_kwargs = {"max_length": 16, "num_beams": 8, "num_return_sequences": 1}
        def predict_step(image_paths):
            images = []
            for image_path in image_paths:
                i_image = Image.open(image_path)
                if i_image.mode != "RGB":
                    i_image = i_image.convert(mode="RGB")

                images.append(i_image)
            pixel_values = feature_extractor(images=images, return_tensors="pt").pixel_values
            pixel_values = pixel_values.to(device)
            output_ids = model.generate(pixel_values, **gen_kwargs)
            preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)
            preds = [pred.strip() for pred in preds]
            return preds

        if __name__ == "__main__":
            print(predict_step(['s7_deployment/exercise_files/my_cat.jpg']))
        ```

    ??? success "Solution"

        ```python linenums="1" title="ml_app.py"
        --8<-- "s7_deployment/exercise_files/ml_app.py"
        ```

9. As the final step, we want to figure out how to include our FastAPI application in a docker container as it will help
    us when we want to deploy in the cloud because docker as always can take care of the dependencies for our
    application. For the following set of exercises you can take whatever previous FastAPI application as the base
    application for the container

    1. Start by creating a `requirement.txt` file for your application. You will at least need `fastapi` and `uvicorn`
        in the file and we always recommend that you are specific about the version you want to use

        ```txt
        fastapi>=0.68.0,<0.69.0
        uvicorn>=0.15.0,<0.16.0
        # add anything else you application needs to be able to run
        ```

    2. Next, create a `Dockerfile` with the following content

        ```Dockerfile
        FROM python:3.11-slim
        WORKDIR /code
        COPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt

        RUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt
        COPY ./app /code/app

        CMD ["uvicorn", "app.main:app", "--host", "0.0.0.0", "--port", "80"]
        ```

        The above assumes that your file structure looks like this

        ```txt
        .
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app
        ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ __init__.py
        ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
        ```

        Hopefully, all these steps should look familiar if you already went through
        [module M9](../s3_reproducibility/docker.md), except for maybe the last line. However, this is just the
        standard way that we have run our FastAPI applications in the last couple of exercises, this time with some
        extra arguments regarding the ports we allow.

    3. Next, build the corresponding docker image

        ```bash
        docker build -t my_fastapi_app .
        ```

    4. Finally, run the image such that a container is spun up that runs our application. The important part here is
        to remember to specify the `-p` argument (p for port) which should be the same number as the port we have
        specified in the last line of our Dockerfile.

        ```bash
        docker run --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage
        ```

    5. Check that everything is working by going to the corresponding localhost page
        <http://localhost/items/5?q=somequery>

This ends the module on APIs. If you want to go further in this direction we highly recommend that you check out
[bentoml](https://github.com/bentoml/BentoML) which is an API standard that focuses solely on creating
easy-to-understand APIs and services for ml-applications. Additionally, we can also highly recommend
checking out [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) which can help design, document and in particular test the API you are
writing to make sure that it works as expected.
