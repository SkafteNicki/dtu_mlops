# 4. The PyTorch Ecosystem

The [Pytorch ecosystem](https://pytorch.org/ecosystem/) is a great place for finding open-source frameworks
that can help you accelate your own research. Today we will have focus on three such frameworks from which
you will have to choose one as the foundation for your project. The three frameworks are:

* [Kornia](https://github.com/kornia/kornia). Kornia is a differentiable computer vision (CV) library for PyTorch,
  that consists of a set of routines and differentiable modules to solve generic computer vision problems.
   
* [Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers). The Transformers reposatory from the Huggingface group
  focuses on state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP). It provides many pretrained model to perform tasks on 
  texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text generation, 
  etc in 100+ languages. Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone.

* [Pytorch-Geometric](https://github.com/rusty1s/pytorch_geometric). PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is a geometric deep learning 
  extension library for PyTorch. It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, 
  also known as geometric deep learning, from a variety of published papers.

Today is also dedicated to doing project work. Remember that the focus of the project work is not
to demonstrate that you can work with the biggest and baddest deep learning model, but instead that you show
that you can incorporate the tools that are teached throughout the course in a meaningfull way.

Also note that the project is not expected to be very large in scope. It may simply be that you
want to train X model on Y data. You will aprroxemately be given 4 full days to work on the project.

### Exercises

1. Familiar yourself with each of the libaries. One way to do this is to find relevant tutorials on each project and try
   to figur out the code. Such tutorials will give you a rough idea how the API for each libary looks like.

2. Form groups! The recommended group size is 4 persons, but we also accept 3 or 5 man groups. Try to other people based
   on what framework that you would like to work with.

3. Brainstorm projects! Try to figure out exactly what you want to work with and especially how you are going to incorporate
   the framework that you have chosen to work with into your project. The **Final exercise** for today is to formulate a
   project description (see bottom of this page).

4. When you formed groups and formed a project you are allowed to start. To start with, do the following

   4.1. Create a github reposatory for your project and make sure that all team members have access to pull
        and push
        
   4.2. Create the folder structure by using the `cookie-cutter` approach

5. From here you are free to work on the parts of the project that you wish. It is recommended to start with
   getting the data sorted out as prior experience have shown that this may take longer time than expected.

### Final objective

Final exercise for today is making a project description. Write around half to one page about:

* Overall goal of the project
* What framework are you going to use
* What data are you going to run on (initially, may change)
* What deep learning models do you expect to use

The project description will serve as an guideline for us at the exam that you have somewhat
reached the goals that you set out to do. 

By the end of the day (17:00) you should upload your project description + whatever you have done on the project
until now to github. When this is done one of your group members should send a email to **nsde@dtu.dk** with:

* Link to github page
* The study number of all members of the group

We will briefly look over your github reposatory and project description to check that everything is fine.

Please note that you are not required to continuously upload your code to github, but we hope that you will 
naturally do this as part of the workflow.
