# Timeplan

[Slides](../slides/Intro%20to%20the%20course.pdf){: .btn .btn-blue }

The course runs in hybrid format, which means that some day you are expected to be at campus and other days
it is optional. All *On-site* days start at 9:00 in the morning with an short lecture (15-30 min) that will 
give some context about atleast one of the topics of that day. The remaining of the day will be spend on 
solving exercises. We aim that the exercises should be able to be solved in around 4 hours, meaning that 
you will be able to get help until 14:00. The rest of the day is dedicated to self study, which means that 
you determine when to stop. We note that since the material is still fairly new, some exercises may take 
less than 4 hours and some may take more.

## Virtual days

Virtual days are intended for project work and you are therefore responsable for making an agreement with 
your group when you are going to work. Please note that on the the first virtual day, a lecture will be given 
at 9:00 with project information. One time during each virtual day we will have office hours where you can 
ask questions. Please note, that while you will not be able to get physical help you are more than welcome 
to still use DTU´s facilities for your group work.

### Week 1

The first week is all about getting set up for the following two weeks. In particular this week focus setting
up a good practise for how to organise and develop code with the focus on making reproducible code.

### Week 2

The second week is about automatization and scalability. Automatization will help use making sure that our code 
does not break when we make changes to it. While many times it does not require huge resources to do development, 
there are always certain phases that require you to scale your experiments. In this week we will focus on getting 
comfortable on how to write distributed application and how we can run them

### Week 3

For the final week we look into advance topics such as deployment and monitoring. Both these topics are 
important for the longivity for the applications that we develop, that we actually can deploy them either 
locally or in the cloud and that we have the tools to monitor how they behave over time.
