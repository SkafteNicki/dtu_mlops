This module is all about scaling the applications that we are building. We are here going to use a very narrow
definition of *scaling* namely that we want our applications to run faster, however one should note that in general
*scaling* is a much broader term. There are many different ways to scale your applications and we are going to look at
three of these related to different tasks machine learning algorithms:

* Scaling data loading
* Scaling training
* Scaling inference

We are going to approach the term *scaling* from two different angles that both should result in your application
running faster. The first approach is levering multiple devices, such as using multiple CPU cores or parallelizing
training across multiple GPUs. The second approach is more analytical, were we are actually going to look at how we can
design smaller/faster model architectures that runs faster.

It should be noted that this module is specific to working with Pytorch applications. In particular we are going to see
how we can both improve base Pytorch code and how to utilize the Pytorch Lightning which we introduced in module
[M14 on boilerplate](../s4_debugging_and_logging/M14_boilerplate.md) to improve the scaling of our applications. If your
application is written using another framework we can guarantee that the same techniques in these modules transfers to
that framework, but may require you do seek out how to specifically to it.

If you manage to complete all modules in this session, feel free to checkout the *extra* module on scalable
[hyperparameter optimization](../s10_extra/M30_hyperparameters.md).
