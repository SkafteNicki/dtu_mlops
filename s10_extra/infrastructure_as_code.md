# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

Infrastructure as Code (IaC) is the process of managing and provisioning computer data centers through machine-readable
definition files, rather than physical hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. The IT infrastructure
managed by this comprises both physical equipment such as bare-metal servers as well as virtual machines and associated
configuration resources. The definitions are written in a high-level programming language and can be versioned, and the
code can be tested and validated.

## Terraform

Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code software tool created by HashiCorp. It enables users to define and
provision a datacenter infrastructure using a high-level configuration language known as Hashicorp Configuration
Language (HCL), or optionally JSON. It allows infrastructure to be expressed as code in a simple, human-readable
language called HCL (HashiCorp Configuration Language). It supports a multitude of cloud providers, including AWS,
Azure, Google Cloud, and many others.

### Installation

To install Terraform, download the appropriate package for your operating system from the
[official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html). Once downloaded, unzip the package and move the
binary to a directory included in your system's PATH.

### Getting started

To get started with Terraform, you need to create a configuration file. This file is a human-readable file that
describes the infrastructure and set of resources to be created. The file is saved with a `.tf` extension. Here is an
example of a simple Terraform configuration file that creates an AWS EC2 instance:

```hcl
provider "aws" {
  region = "us-west-2"
}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
  ami           = "ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0"
  instance_type = "t2.micro"
}
```

To create the infrastructure described in the configuration file, navigate to the directory containing the file and run
the following commands:

```bash
terraform init
terraform apply
```

The `terraform init` command is used to initialize a working directory containing Terraform configuration files. This is
the first command that should be run after writing a new Terraform configuration or cloning an existing one from version
control. The `terraform apply` command is used to apply the changes required to reach the desired state of the
configuration, or the pre-determined set of actions generated by a `terraform plan` execution plan.
