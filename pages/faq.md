# Frequently asked questions

For further questions, please contact [Nicki](mailto:nsde@dtu.dk).

## When is the next time the course is running ❔

The course always runs in January, during the 3-week period at DTU. The exact dates can be found in the
[academic calendar](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/student-guide/studying-at-dtu/academic-calendar).

## Is it possible to attend the course fully online ❔

Mostly yes. All exercises are provided online and lectures will be recorded and streamed. However, do note that

* For project days (see which days in the [time plan](timeplan.md)) you will need to agree with your project group that
    you are working from home.
* We have limited TA resources and will be prioritizing students coming to campus for help. If you are attending online,
    feel free to ask questions on our Slack channel, and we will help to the best of our ability.

Overall we try to support flexible learning as much as possible with some limitations.

## What are the prerequisites for taking this course ❔

We recommend that you have a basic understanding of machine learning concepts such as what a dataset is, what
probabilities are, what a classifier is, what overfitting means etc. This corresponds to the curriculum covered in
course [02450](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02450). The actual focus of the course is not on machine learning models,
but we will be using these basic concepts throughout the exercises.

Additionally, we recommend basic knowledge about deep learning and how to code in [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/),
corresponding to the curriculum covered in [02456](https://kurser.dtu.dk/course/02456). From prior experience, we know
that not all students have gained knowledge about deep learning models before this course, and we will be covering the
basics of how to code in PyTorch in one of the
[first modules](../s1_development_environment/deep_learning_software.md) of the course to get everyone up to speed.

## I will be missing X days of the course, will that be a problem ❔

Depends. The course is fairly intensive, with most students working from 9-17 every day. If you already know that you
will be missing X days of the course, then I highly recommend that you go through some of the first sessions before
the course starts to give yourself a bit of breathing room. If you are not able to do so, please be aware that an
additional effort may be needed from you to keep up with your fellow students.

## How many should we be in a group for the projects ❔

Between 3 and 5. The projects are designed to be done in groups meaning that we intentionally make them too big for
one person to do alone. Luckily, a lot of the work that you need to do can be done in parallel, so it is not as bad
as it sounds.

## When will the exam take place ❔

From 2025 and onwards, the exam only consists of a project report. The report should be handed in at midnight on the
final day of the course. For January 2025, this means the 24th.

## Where can I find information regarding the exam ❔

Look at the bottom of this [page](projects.md). Details will be updated as we get closer to the exam date.

## Can I use ChatGPT or similar tools for the exercises, project, exam report (coding + writing) ❔

Yes, yes, and yes, but remember that it's a tool, and you need to validate the output before using it. We would prefer
for the exam report that you formulate the answers in your own words because it is intended for you do describe what
you have been doing in your project. *The I in LLM stands for intelligence.*

## I am a PhD student not enrolled at DTU, can I take the course ❔

Yes, PhD students from other universities can attend the course. You can check out
[this page](https://www.dtu.dk/english/education/phd/intro/guest-phd/guest_courses) for more information or in general
you can contact <phdcourses@dtu.dk> for more information. Do note that the registration deadline is usually in beginning
of December.

## I am a foreign student and my home university doesn't accept pass/no-pass, what can I do ❔

We can give a grade on the Danish
[7-point grading](https://ufm.dk/en/education/the-danish-education-system/grading-system) scale for foreign students who
need it, where their home university does not accept pass/no-pass. You need to contact the course responsible
[Nicki](mailto:nsde@dtu.dk) within the first week of the course to request this. Secondly, we may need to further
validate your work, so please be prepared for doing a short oral exam on one of the last days of the course.

## I am a EuroTeQ student, any special rules for me ❔

Not really, you will attend the course as any other student. However, we will provide a special Slack channel for you,
trying to make sure that you can get the same help as students from DTU who can attend the course on campus.
