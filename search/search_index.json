The term itself is a compound of \"machine learning\" and \"operations\" and covers everything that has to do with the management of the production ML lifecycle.</p> <p>The lifecycle of production ML can largely be divided into three phases:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Design: The initial phase starts with an investigation of the problem. Based on this analysis, several requirements     can be prioritized for what we want our future model to do. Since machine learning requires     data to be trained, we also investigate in this step what data we have and if we need to source it in some other way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Model development: Based on the design phase we can begin to conjure some machine learning algorithms to solve our     problems. As always, the initial step often involves doing some data analysis to make sure that our model is     learning the signal that we want it to learn. Secondly, is the machine learning engineering phase, where the     particular model architecture is chosen. Finally, we also need to do validation and testing to make sure that     our model is generalizing well.</p> </li> <li> <p>Operations: Based on the model development phase, we now have a model that we want to use. The operations are where     create an automatic pipeline that makes sure that whenever we make changes to our codebase they get automatically     incorporated into our model, such that we do not slow down production. Equally important is the ongoing monitoring     of already deployed models to make sure that they behave exactly as we specified them.</p> </li> </ol> <p>It is important to note that the three steps are a cycle, meaning that when you have successfully deployed a machine learning model that is not the end of it. Your initial requirements may change, forcing you to revisit the design phase. Some new algorithms may show promising results, so you revisit the model development phase to implement this. Finally, you may try to cut the cost of running your model in production, making you revisit the operations phase, and trying to optimize some steps.</p> <p>The focus in this course is particularly on the Operations part of MLOps as this is what many data scientists are missing in their toolbox to take all the knowledge they have about data processing and model development into a production setting.</p>"},{"location":"#learning-objectives","title":"\u2754 Learning objectives","text":"<p>General course objective</p> <p>Introduce the student to a number of coding practices that will help them organization, scale, monitor and deploy machine learning models either in a research or production setting.

This page provides a summary of the frameworks in this course e.g. the stack of tools used. In the figure below we have provided an overview on how the different tools of the course interacts with each other. The table after the figure provides a short description of each of the parts.</p> <p></p>  The MLOps stack in the course. This is just an example of one stack, and depending on your use case you may want to use a different stack of tools that better fits your needs. Regardless of the stack, the principles of MLOps are the same.  Framework Description PyTorch is the backbone of our code, it provides the computational engine and the data structures that we need to define our data structures. PyTorch lightning is a framework that provides a high-level interface to PyTorch. It provides a lot of functionality that we need to train our models, such as logging, checkpointing, early stopping, etc. such that we do not have to implement it ourselves. It also allows us to scale our models to multiple GPUs and multiple nodes. We control the dependencies and Python interpreter using Conda that enables us to construct reproducible virtual environments For configuring our experiments we use Hydra that allows us to define a hierarchical configuration structure config files Using Weights and Bias allows us to track and log any values and hyperparameters for our experiments Whenever we run into performance bottlenecks with our code we can use the Profiler to find the cause of the bottleneck When we run into bugs in our code we can use the Debugger to find the cause of the bug For organizing our code and creating templates we can use Cookiecutter Docker is a tool that allows us to create a container that contains all the dependencies and code that we need to run our code For controlling the versions of our data and synchronization between local and remote data storage, we can use DVC that makes this process easy For version control of our code we use Git (in complement with GitHub) that allows multiple developers to work together on a shared codebase We can use Pytest to write unit tests for our code, to make sure that new changes to the code does break the code base For linting our code and keeping a consistent coding style we can use tools such as Pylint and Flake8 that checks our code for common mistakes and style issues For running our unit tests and other checks on our code in a continuous manner e.g. after we commit and push our code we can use GitHub actions that automate this process Using Cloud build we can automate the process of building our docker images and pushing them to our artifact registry Artifact registry is a service that allows us to store our docker images for later use by other services For storing our data and trained models we can use Cloud storage that provides a scalable and secure storage solution For general compute tasks we can use Compute engine that provides a scalable and secure compute solution For training our experiments in a easy and scalable manner we can use Vertex AI For creating a REST API for our model we can use FastAPI that provides a high-level interface for creating APIs For simple deployments of our code we can use Cloud functions that allows us to run our code in response to events through simple Python functions For more complex deployments of our code we can use Cloud run that allows us to run our code in response to events through docker containers Cloud monitoring gives us the tools to keep track of important logs and errors from the other cloud services For monitoring our deployed model is experiencing any drift we can use Evidently AI that provides a framework and dashboard for monitoring drift For monitoring the telemetry of our deployed model we can use OpenTelemetry that provides a standard for collecting and exporting telemetry data"},{"location":"pages/projects/","title":"Project work","text":"<p>Slides</p> <p>Approximately 1/3 of the course time is dedicated to doing project work.

The great thing about the open-source community is that whatever problem you are working on, there is probably some package out there that can get you at least 10% of the way. For the project, we want to enforce this point, and you are required to include some third-party package, that is neither PyTorch nor one of the tools already covered in the course, into your project.</p> <p>If you have no idea what framework to include, the PyTorch ecosystem is a great place for finding open-source frameworks that can help you accelerate your own projects where PyTorch is the back engine. All tools in the ecosystem should work greatly together with PyTorch. However, it is important to note that the ecosystem is not a complete list of all the awesome packages that exist to extend the functionality of PyTorch. If you are still missing inspiration for frameworks to use, we highly recommend these three that have been used in previous years of the course:</p> <ul> <li> <p>PyTorch Image Models. PyTorch Image Models (also known as TIMM)     is the absolutely most used computer vision package (maybe except for <code>torchvision</code>). It contains models, scripts     and pre-trained for a lot of state-of-the-art image models within computer vision.</p> </li> <li> <p>Transformers. The transformers repository from the Huggingface group     focuses on state-of-the-art Natural Language Processing (NLP). It provides many pre-trained model to perform tasks on     texts such as classification, information extraction, question answering, summarization, translation, text     generation, etc. in 100+ languages. Its aim is to make cutting-edge NLP easier to use for everyone.</p> </li> <li> <p>PyTorch-Geometric. PyTorch Geometric (PyG) is a geometric deep     learning. It consists of various methods for deep learning on graphs and other irregular structures, also known as     geometric deep learning, from a variety of published papers.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"pages/projects/#project-days","title":"Project days","text":"<p>Each project day is fully dedicated to project work, except for maybe external inspirational lectures in the morning.

We recommend that you start out with less than 1GB of data. If the dataset you want to work with     is larger, then subsample it. You can use dvc to version control your data and only download the full dataset     when you are ready to train the model.</p> </li> <li> <p>Be aware of many smaller files. <code>DVC</code> does not handle many small files well, and can take a long time to download.     If you have many small files, consider zipping them together and then unzip them at runtime.</p> </li> <li> <p>You do not need to use <code>DVC</code> for everything regarding data. You workflow is to just use <code>DVC</code> for version     controlling the data, but when you need to get it you can just download it from the source. For example if you     are storing your data in a GCP bucket, you can use the <code>gsutil</code> command to download the data or directly     accessing the it using the     cloud storage file system</p> </li> </ul> <p>Modelling</p> <ul> <li> <p>Again, start out small! Start with a simple model and then add complexity as you go along. It is better to have a     simple model that works than a complex model that does not work.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try fine-tuning a pre-trained model.

The ability to create clear, concise, and user-friendly technical documentation can make a significant difference in the success of your codebase. We all probably encountered code that we wanted to use, only for us to abandon using it because it was missing documentation such that we could get started with it.</p> <p>Technical documentation or code documentation can be many things:</p> <ul> <li>Plain text, images and videos explaining core concepts for your software</li> <li>Documentation of API on how to call a function or class, what the different parameters are etc.</li> <li>Code examples of how to use certain functionality</li> </ul> <p>and many more. We are in this module going to focus on setting up a very basic documentation system that will automatically help you document the API of your code. For this reason we recommend that before continuing with this module that you have completed module M7 on good coding practices or have similar experience with writing docstrings for Python functions and classes.</p> <p>There are different systems for writing documentation. In fact there is a lot to choose from:</p> <ul> <li>MkDocs</li> <li>Sphinx</li> <li>GitBook</li> <li>Docusaurus</li> <li>Doxygen</li> <li>Jekyll</li> </ul> <p>Important to note that all these are static site generators. The word static here refers to that when the content is generated and served on a webside, the underlying HTML code will not change. It may contain HTML elements that dynamic (like video), but the site does not change (1).</p> <ol> <li> Good examples of dynamic sites are any social media or news media where new posts, pages etc.     are constantly added over time. Good examples of static sites are documentation, blogposts etc.</li> </ol> <p>We are in this module going to look at Mkdocs, which (in my opinion) is one of the easiest systems to get started with because all documentation is written in markdown and the build system is written in Python. As an alternativ, you can consider doing the exercises in Sphinx which is probably the most used documentation system for Python code. Sphinx offer more customization than Mkdocs, so is generally preferred for larger projects with complex documentation, but for smaller projects Mkdocs should be easier to get started with and is sufficient.</p> <p>Mkdocs by default does not include many features and for that reason we are directly going to dive into using the material for mkdocs theme that provides a lot of nice customization to create professional static sites. In fact, this whole course is written in mkdocs using the material theme.</p>"},{"location":"s10_extra/documentation/#mkdocs","title":"Mkdocs","text":"<p>The core file when using mkdocs is the <code>mkdocs.yaml</code> file, which is the configuration file for the project:</p> <pre><code>site_name: Documentation of my project\nsite_author: Jane Doe\ndocs_dir: source # (1)!\n\ntheme:\n    language: en\n    name: material # (2)!\n    features: # (3)!\n    - content.code.copy\n    - content.code.annotate\n\nplugins: # (4)!\n    - search\n    - mkdocstrings\n\nnav: # (5)!\n  - Home: index.md\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p> This indicates the source directory of our documentation.

In this example we have enabled <code>content.code.copy</code> feature which adds a small copy button to all code block and the     <code>content.code.annotate</code> feature which allows you to add annotations like this box to code blocks.</p> </li> <li> <p> Plugins add new functionality to your documentation.     In this case we have added two plugins that add functionality for searching through our documentation and     automatically adding documentation from docstrings. Remember that some plugins requires you to install additional     Python packages with those plugins, so remember to add them to your <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p> </li> <li> <p> The <code>nav</code> section is where you define the navigation structure of your documentation.

A supercomputer (as shown below) is organized into different modules, that are separated by network link. When you login to a supercomputer you will meet the front end which contains all the software needed to run computations. When you submit a job it will get sent to the backend modules which in most cases includes: general compute modules (CPU), acceleration modules (GPU), a memory module (RAM) and finally a storage module (HDD). Depending on your application you may need one module more than another. For example in deep learning the acceleration module is important but in physics simulation the general compute module / storage model is probably more important.</p> <p></p>  Overview of the Meluxina supercomputer that's part of EuroHPC.  Image credit  <p>Alternatively, LSF are a network of computers where each computer has its own CPU, GPU, RAM etc. and the individual computes (or nodes) are then connected by network. The important different between a supercomputer and as LSF systems is how the resources are organized. When comparing supercomputers to LSF system it is generally the case that it is better to run on a LSF system if you are only requesting resources that can be handled by a single node, however it is better to run on a supercomputer if you have a resource intensive application that requires many devices to communicate with each others.</p> <p>Regardless of cluster architectures, on the software side of HPC, the most important part is what's called the HPC scheduler. Without a HPC scheduler an HPC cluster would just be a bunch of servers with different jobs interfering with each other. The problem is when you have a large collection of resources and a large collection of users, you cannot rely on the users just running their applications without interfering with each other. A HPC scheduler is in charge of managing that whenever an user request to run an application, they get put in a queue and whenever the resources their application ask for are available the application gets run.</p> <p>The biggest bach control systems for doing scheduling on HPC are:</p> <ul> <li>SLURM</li> <li>MOAB HPC Suite</li> <li>PBS Works</li> </ul> <p>We are going to take a look at PBS works as that is what is installed on our local university cluster.</p>"},{"location":"s10_extra/high_performance_clusters/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>Exercise files</p> <p>The following exercises are focused on local students at DTU that want to use our local HPC resources. That said, the steps in the exercise are fairly general to other types of cluster. For the purpose of this exercise we are going to see how we can run this image classifier script , but feel free to work with whatever application you want to.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by accessing the cluster. This can either be through <code>ssh</code> in a terminal or if you want a graphical interface     thinlinc can be installed. In general we recommend following the steps     here for DTU students as the setup depends on if you are on campus or not.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you have access to the cluster we are going to start with the setup phase. In the setup phase we are going     to setup the environment necessary for our computations. If you have accessed the cluster through graphical interface     start by opening a terminal.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Lets start by setting up conda for controlling our dependencies. If you have not already worked with <code>conda</code>,     please checkout module     M2 on package managers and virtual environments. In general     you should be able to setup (mini)conda through these two commands:</p> <pre><code>wget https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\nsh Miniconda3-latest-Linux-x86_64.sh\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Close the terminal and open a new for the installation to complete. Type <code>conda</code> in the terminal to check that     everything is fine. Go ahead and create a new environment that we can install dependencies in</p> <pre><code>conda create -n \"hpc_env\" python=3.10 --no-default-packages\n</code></pre> <p>and activate it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copy over any files you need. For the image classifier script you need the     requirements file     and the actual     application.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, install all the requirements you need. If you want to run the image classifier script you can run this     command in the terminal</p> <pre><code>pip install -r image_classifier_requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>using this requirements file.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>That's all the setup needed. You would need to go through the creating of environment and installation of requirements     whenever you start a new project (no need for reinstalling conda). For the next step we need to look at how to submit     jobs on the cluster. We are now ready to submit the our first job to the cluster:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by checking the statistics for the different clusters. Try to use both the <code>qstat</code> command which should give     an overview of the different cluster, number of running jobs and number of pending jobs. For many system you can     also try the much more user friendly command <code>classstat</code> command.</p> </li> <li> <p>Figure out which queue you want to use. For the sake of the exercises it needs to be one with GPU support. For     DTU students, any queue that starts with <code>gpu</code> are GPU accelerated.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now we are going to develop a bash script for submitting our job. We have provided an example of such     scripts. Take a     careful look and go each line and make sure you understand it. Afterwards, change it to your needs     (queue and student email).</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to submit the script:</p> <pre><code>bsub &lt; jobscript.sh\n</code></pre> <p>You can check the status of your script by running the <code>bstat</code> command. Hopefully, the job should go through really quickly. Take a look at the output file, it should be called something like <code>gpu_*.out</code>. Also take a look at the <code>gpu_*.err</code> file. Does both files look as they should?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Lets now try to run our application on the cluster. To do that we need to take care of two things:</p> <ol> <li> <p>First we need to load the correct version of CUDA. A cluster system often contains multiple versions of specific     software to suit the needs of all their users, and it is the users that are in charge of loading the correct     software during job submission. The only extra software that needs to be loaded for most PyTorch applications     are a CUDA module. You can check which modules are available on the cluster with</p> <pre><code>module avail\n</code></pre> <p>Afterwards, add the correct CUDA version you need to the <code>jobscript.sh</code> file. If you are trying to run the provided image classifier script then the correct version is <code>CUDA/11.7</code> (can be seen in the requirements file).</p> <pre><code># add to the bottom of the file\nmodule load cuda/11.7\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>We are now ready to add in our application. The only thing we need to take care of is telling the system to run     it using the <code>python</code> version that is connected to our <code>hpc_env</code> we created in the beginning. Try typing:</p> <pre><code>which python\n</code></pre> <p>which should give you the full path. Then add to the bottom of the <code>jobscript</code> file:</p> <pre><code>~/miniconda3/envs/hpc_env/bin/python \\\n    image_classifier.py \\\n    --trainer.accelerator 'gpu' --trainer.devices 1  --trainer.max_epochs 5\n</code></pre> <p>which will run the image classifier script (change it if you are running something else).</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally submit the job:</p> <pre><code>bsub &lt; jobscript.sh\n</code></pre> <p>and check when it is done that it has produced what you expected.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) If you application supports multi GPUs also try that out. You would first need to change the     jobscript to request multiple GPUs and additionally you would need to tell your application to run on multiple     GPUs. For the image classifier script it can be done by changing the <code>--trainer.devices</code> flag     to <code>2</code> (or higher).</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>This ends the module on using HPC systems.</p>"},{"location":"s10_extra/hyperparameters/","title":"M33 - Hyperparameter optimization","text":""},{"location":"s10_extra/hyperparameters/#hyperparameter-optimization","title":"Hyperparameter optimization","text":"<p>Outdated module</p> <p>This module has not been updated for a long time and therefore some functionality of Optuna, which is used in these exercises, may not be included. If you have completed the module on Weights &amp; Bias then we highly recommend instead using their sweep functionality.</p> <p>Hyperparameter optimization is not a new idea within machine learning but have somewhat seen a renaissance with the uprise of deep learning. This can mainly be contributed to the following:</p> <ul> <li>Trying to beat state-of-the-art often comes down to very small differences in performance, and hyperparameter     optimization can help squeeze out a bit more</li> <li>Deep learning models are in general not that robust towards the choice of hyparameter so choosing the wrong set     may lead to a model that does not work</li> </ul> <p>However the problem with doing hyperparameter optimization of a deep learning models is that it can take over a week to train a single model. In most cases we therefore cannot do a full grid search of all hyperparameter combinations to get the best model. Instead we have to do some tricks that will help us speed up our searching. In these exercises we are going to be integrating optuna into our different models, that will provide the tools for speeding up our search.</p> <p></p> <p>It should be noted that a lot of deep learning models does not optimize every hyperparameter that is included in the model but instead relies on heuristic guidelines (\"rule of thumb\") based on what seems to be working in general e.g. a learning rate of 0.01 seems to work great with the Adam optimizer. That said, these rules probably only apply to 80% of deep learning model, whereas for the last 20% the recommendations may be suboptimal Here is a great site that has collected an extensive list of these recommendations, taken from the excellent deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio and Aaron Courville.</p> <p>In practice, I recommend trying to identify (through experimentation) which hyperparameters that are important for the performance of your model and then spend your computational budget trying to optimize them while setting the rest to a \"recommended value\".</p>"},{"location":"s10_extra/hyperparameters/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>Exercise files</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by installing optuna:     <code>pip install optuna</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Initially we will look at the <code>cross_validate.py</code> file. It implements simple K-fold cross validation of     a random forest sklearn digits dataset (subset of MNIST). Look over the script and try to run it.</p> </li> <li> <p>We will now try to write the same code in optune. Please note that the script have a variable <code>OPTUNA=False</code>     that you can use to change what part of the code should run. The three main concepts of optuna is</p> <ul> <li> <p>A trial: a single experiment</p> </li> <li> <p>A study: a collection of trials</p> </li> <li> <p>The objective: function to determine how \"good\" a trial is</p> </li> </ul> <p>Lets start by writing the objective function, which we have already started in the script. For now you do not need to care about the <code>trial</code> argument, just assume that it contains the hyperparameters needed to define your random forest model. The output of the objective function should be a single number that we want to optimize. (HINT: did you remember to do K-fold crossvalidation inside your objective function?)</p> </li> <li> <p>Next lets focus on the trial. Inside the <code>objective</code> function the trial should be used to suggest what     parameters to use next. Take a look at the documentation for     trial or take a look at     the code examples and figure out how to define the hyperparameter of the model.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally lets launch a study. It can be as simple as</p> <pre><code>study = optuna.create_study()\nstudy.optimize(objective, n_trials=100)\n</code></pre> <p>but lets play around a bit with it:</p> <ol> <li> <p>By default the <code>.optimize</code> method will minimize the objective (by definition the optimum of an objective     function is at its minimum). Is the score your objective function is returning something that should     be minimized? If not, a simple solution is to put a <code>-</code> in front of the metric. However, look through     the documentation on how to change the direction of the optimization.</p> </li> <li> <p>Optuna will by default do Bayesian optimization when sampling the hyperparameters (using a evolutionary     algorithm for suggesting new trials). However, since this example is quite simple, we can actually     perform a full grid search. How would you do this in Optuna?</p> </li> <li> <p>Compare the performance of a single optuna run using Bayesian optimization with <code>n_trials=10</code> with a     exhaustive grid search that have search through all hyperparameters. What is the performance/time     trade-off for these two solutions?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>In addition to doing baysian optimization, the other great part about Optuna is that it have native support     for Pruning unpromising trials. Pruning refers to the user stopping trials for hyperparameter combinations     that does not seem to lead anywhere. You may have learning rate that is so high that training is diverging or     a neural network with too many parameters so it is just overfitting to the training data. This however begs the     question: what constitutes an unpromising trial? This is up to you to define based on prior experimentation.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by looking at the <code>fashion_trainer.py</code> script. Its a simple classification network for classifying     images in the FashionMNIST dataset. Run the script     with the default hyperparameters to get a feeling of how the training should be progress.     Note down the performance on the test set.</p> </li> <li> <p>Start by defining a validation set and a validation dataloader that we can use for hyperparameter optimization     (HINT: use 5-10% of you training data).</p> </li> <li> <p>Now, adjust the script to use Optuna. The 5 hyperparameters listed in the table above should at least be included     in the hyperparameter search. For some we have already defined the search space but for the remaining you need to     come up with a good range of values to investigate. We done integrating optuna, run a small study (<code>n_tirals=3</code>)     to check that the code is working.</p> Hyperparameter Search space Learning rate 1e-6 to 1e0 Number of output features in the second last layer ??? The amount of dropout to apply ??? Batch size ??? Use batch normalize or not {True, False} (Optional) Different activations functions {<code>nn.ReLU</code>, <code>nn.Tanh</code>, <code>nn.RReLU</code>, <code>nn.LeakyReLU</code>, <code>nn.ELU</code>} </li> <li> <p>If implemented correctly the number of hyperparameter combinations should be at least 1000, meaning that     we not only need baysian optimization but probably also need pruning to succeed. Checkout the page for     built-in pruners in Optuna. Implement     pruning in the script. I recommend using either the <code>MedianPruner</code> or the <code>ProcentilePruner</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Re-run the study using pruning with a large number of trials (<code>n_trials&gt;50</code>)</p> </li> <li> <p>Take a look at this     visualization page     for ideas on how to visualize the study you just did. Make at least two visualization of the study and     make sure that you understand them.</p> </li> <li> <p>Pruning is great for better spending your computational budged, however it comes with a trade-off. What is     it and what hyperparameter should one be especially careful about when using pruning?</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, what parameter combination achieved the best performance? What is the test set performance for this     set of parameters. Did you improve over the initial set of hyperparameters?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>The exercises until now have focused on doing the hyperparameter searching sequentially, meaning that we test one     set of parameters at the time. It is a fine approach because you can easily let it run for a week without any     interaction. However, assuming that you have the computational resources to run in parallel, how do you do that?</p> <ol> <li> <p>To run hyperparameter search in parallel we need a common database that all experiments can read and     write to. We are going to use the recommended <code>mysql</code>. You do not have to understand what SQL is to     complete this exercise, but it is basically a language (like python)     for managing databases. Install mysql.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next we are going to initialize a database that we can read and write to. For this exercises we are going     to focus on a locally stored database but it could of course also be located in the cloud.</p> <pre><code>mysql -u root -e \"CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS example\"\n</code></pre> <p>you can also do this directly in Python when calling the <code>create_study</code> command by also setting the <code>storage</code> and <code>load_if_exists=True</code> flags.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now we are going to create a Optuna study in our database</p> <pre><code>optuna create-study --study-name \"distributed-example\" --storage \"mysql://root@localhost/example\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Change how you initialize the study to read and write to the database. Therefore, instead of doing</p> <pre><code>study = optuna.create_study()\n</code></pre> <p>then do</p> <pre><code>study = optuna.load_study(\n    study_name=\"distributed-example\", storage=\"mysql://root@localhost/example\"\n)\n</code></pre> <p>where the <code>study_name</code> and <code>storage</code> should match how the study was created.</p> </li> <li> <p>For running in parallel, you can either open up a extra terminal and simple launch your script once     per open terminal or you can use the provided <code>parallel_lancher.py</code> that will launch multiple executions     of your script. It should be used as:</p> <pre><code>python parallel_lancher.py myscript.py --num_parallel 2\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Finally, make sure that you can access the results</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>That's all on how to do hyperparameter optimization in a scalable way. If you feel like it you can try to apply these techniques on the ongoing corrupted MNIST example, where you are free to choose what hyperparameters that you want to use.</p>"},{"location":"s1_development_environment/","title":"Setting up a development environment","text":"<p>Slides</p> <ul> <li> <p></p> <p>Learn the basics of the command line, and how to use it to navigate your file system and run programs.</p> <p> M1: Command line</p> </li> <li> <p></p> <p>Learn how package managers work in Python and how to create reproducible virtual environments using <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code>.</p> <p> M2: Package Manager</p> </li> <li> <p></p> <p>Learn how to use a modern editor for code development.</p> <p> M3: Editor</p> </li> <li> <p></p> <p>Refresh your PyTorch skills and implement a simple deep-learning model.</p> <p> M4: Deep Learning Software</p> </li> </ul> <p>Today we start our journey into the world of machine learning operations (MLOps).

From Google Translate to driverless cars to personal assistants to protein engineering, deep learning is transforming nearly every sector of our economy and our lives. However, it did not take long before people realized that deep learning is not a simple beast to tame and it comes with its own kinds of problems, especially if you want to use it in a production setting. In particular, the concept of technical debt was invented to indicate the significant maintenance costs at a system level that it takes to run machine learning in production. MLOps should very much be seen as the response to the concept of technical debt, namely that we should develop methods, processes, and tools (with inspiration from classical DevOps) to counter the problems we run into when working with deep learning models.</p> <p>It is important to note that all the concepts and tools that have been developed for MLOps can be used together with more classical machine learning models (think K-nearest neighbor, Random forest, etc.), however, deep learning comes with its own set of problems which mostly have to do with the sheer size of the data and models we are working with. For these reasons, we are focusing on working with deep learning models in this course.</p>"},{"location":"s1_development_environment/deep_learning_software/#software-landscape-for-deep-learning","title":"Software Landscape for Deep Learning","text":"<p>Regarding software for Deep Learning, the landscape is currently dominated by three software frameworks (listed in order of when they were published):</p> <p> </p> <ul> <li> <p>TensorFlow</p> </li> <li> <p>PyTorch</p> </li> <li> <p>JAX</p> </li> </ul> <p>We won't go into a longer discussion on which framework is best, as it is pointless. PyTorch and TensorFlow have been around for the longest and therefore have bigger communities and feature sets at this point in time. They are both very similar in the sense that they both have features directed against research and production. JAX is kind of the new kid on the block, which in many ways improves on PyTorch and TensorFlow, but is still not as mature as the other frameworks. As the frameworks use different kinds of programming principles (object-oriented vs. functional programming), comparing them is essentially meaningless.</p> <p>In this course, we have chosen to work with PyTorch because we find it a bit more intuitive and it is the framework that we use for our day-to-day research life. Additionally, as of right now, it is absolutely the dominating framework for published models, research papers, and competition winners.</p> <p>The intention behind this set of exercises is to bring everyone's PyTorch skills up to date. If you already are a PyTorch-Jedi, feel free to pass the first set of exercises, but I recommend that you still complete it. The exercises are, in large part, taken directly from the deep learning course at Udacity. Note that these exercises are given as notebooks, which is the last time we are going to use them actively in the course. Instead, after this set of exercises, we are going to focus on writing code in Python scripts.</p> <p>The notebooks contain a lot of explanatory text. The exercises that you are supposed to fill out are inlined in the text in small \"exercise\" blocks:</p> <p></p> <p>If you need a refresher on any deep learning topic in general throughout the course, we recommend finding the relevant chapter in the deep learning book by Ian Goodfellow, Yoshua Bengio, and Aaron Courville (which can also be found in the literature folder). It is not necessary to be good at deep learning to pass this course as the focus is on all the software needed to get deep learning models into production.

If this is not done, then gradients would accumulate over the steps leading to exploding gradients. <code>loss.backward()</code> is in charge of calculating the gradients. If this is not done, then the gradients will not be calculated and the optimizer will not be able to update the weights. <code>optimizer.step()</code> is in charge of updating the weights.

Add something simple to the <code>hello.py</code> file like:</p> <p>  Image credit  </p> <p>and click the <code>run</code> button as shown in the image.

In addition to clicking the <code>run</code> button, you can also:</p> <ul> <li>Select some code and press <code>Shift+Enter</code> to run it in the terminal</li> <li>Select some code and right-click, choosing to run in an interactive window (where you can interact with the results     like in a Jupyter Notebook)</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>That's the basics of using VS Code.

Try to write some code in a new Python file and see if you can get some     suggestions from GitHub Copilot on how to complete the code.

No matter what you want to do, there is probably a package that can get you started. Just try to remember the last time you wrote a program only using the Python standard library. Probably never. For this reason, we need a way to install third-party packages and this is where package managers come into play.</p> <p>You have probably already used <code>pip</code> for the longest time, which is the default package manager for Python. <code>pip</code> is great for beginners but it is missing one essential feature that you will need as a developer or data scientist: virtual environments. Virtual environments are an essential way to make sure that the dependencies of different projects do not cross-contaminate each other. As a naive example, consider project A that requires <code>torch==1.3.0</code> and project B that requires <code>torch==2.0</code>, then doing</p> <pre><code>cd project_A  # move to project A\npip install torch==1.3.0  # install old torch version\ncd ../project_B  # move to project B\npip install torch==2.0  # install new torch version\ncd ../project_A  # move back to project A\npython main.py  # try executing main script from project A\n</code></pre> <p>will mean that even though we are executing the main script from project A's folder, it will use <code>torch==2.0</code> instead of <code>torch==1.3.0</code> because that is the last version we installed. In both cases, <code>pip</code> will install the package into the same environment, in this case, the global environment. Instead, if we did something like:</p> Unix/macOSWindows <pre><code>cd project_A  # move to project A\npython -m venv env  # create a virtual environment in project A\nsource env/bin/activate  # activate that virtual environment\npip install torch==1.3.0  # Install the old torch version into the virtual environment belonging to project A\ncd ../project_B  # move to project B\npython -m venv env  # create a virtual environment in project B\nsource env/bin/activate  # activate that virtual environment\npip install torch==2.0  # Install new torch version into the virtual environment belonging to project B\ncd ../project_A  # Move back to project A\nsource env/bin/activate  # Activate the virtual environment belonging to project A\npython main.py  # Succeed in executing the main script from project A\n</code></pre> <pre><code>cd project_A  # Move to project A\npython -m venv env  # Create a virtual environment in project A\n.\\env\\Scripts\\activate  # Activate that virtual environment\npip install torch==1.3.0  # Install the old torch version into the virtual environment belonging to project A\ncd ../project_B  # Move to project B\npython -m venv env  # Create a virtual environment in project B\n.\\env\\Scripts\\activate  # Activate that virtual environment\npip install torch==2.0  # Install new torch version into the virtual environment belonging to project B\ncd ../project_A  # Move back to project A\n.\\env\\Scripts\\activate  # Activate the virtual environment belonging to project A\npython main.py  # Succeed in executing the main script from project A\n</code></pre> <p>then we would be sure that <code>torch==1.3.0</code> is used when executing <code>main.py</code> in project A because we are using two different virtual environments. In the above case, we used the venv module which is the built-in Python module for creating virtual environments. <code>venv+pip</code> is arguably a good combination but when working on multiple projects it can quickly become a hassle to manage all the different virtual environments yourself, remembering which Python version to use, which packages to install and so on.</p> <p>For this reason, a number of package managers have been created that can help you manage your virtual environments and dependencies, with some of the most popular being:</p> \ud83c\udf1f Framework \ud83d\udcc4 Docs \ud83d\udcc2 Repository \u2b50 GitHub Stars Conda \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 6.5k Pipenv \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 24.9k Poetry \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 32.1k Pipx \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 10.8k Hatch \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 6.2k PDM \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 8.0k uv \ud83d\udd17 Link \ud83d\udd17 Link 34.0k <p>This is considered a problem in the Python community because it means that there is no standard way of managing dependencies like in other languages like <code>npm</code> for <code>node.js</code> or <code>cargo</code> for <code>rust</code> (however, it does seem like <code>uv</code> is trying to become the standard, quickly gaining popularity and being adopted by many projects).</p> <p></p>  Image credit  <p>In the course, we do not care about which package manager you use, but we do care that you use one. If you are already familiar with one package manager, then skip this exercise and continue to use that. The best recommendation that I can give regarding package managers, in general, is to find one you like and then stick with it. A lot of time can be wasted on trying to find the perfect package manager, but in the end, they all do the same with some minor differences. Check out this blog post if you want a fairly up-to-date evaluation of the different environment management and packaging tools that exist in the Python ecosystem.</p> <p>If you are not familiar with any package managers, then we recommend that you use <code>conda</code> and <code>pip</code> for this course. You probably already have conda installed on your laptop, which is great. What conda does especially well is that it allows you to create virtual environments with different Python versions, which can be really useful if you encounter dependencies that have not been updated in a long time. In this course specifically, we are going to recommend the following workflow</p> <ul> <li>Use <code>conda</code> to create virtual environments with specific Python versions</li> <li>Use <code>pip</code> to install packages in that environment</li> </ul> <p>Installing packages with <code>pip</code> inside <code>conda</code> environments has been considered a bad practice for a long time, but since <code>conda&gt;=4.6</code> it is considered safe to do so. The reason for this is that <code>conda</code> now has a built-in compatibility layer that makes sure that <code>pip</code> installed packages are compatible with the other packages installed in the environment.</p>"},{"location":"s1_development_environment/package_manager/#python-dependencies","title":"Python dependencies","text":"<p>Before we get started with the exercises, let's first talk a bit about Python dependencies. One of the most common ways to specify dependencies in the Python community is through a <code>requirements.txt</code> file, which is a simple text file that contains a list of all the packages that you want to install. The format allows you to specify the package name and version number you want, with 7 different operators:</p> <pre><code>package1           # any version\npackage2 == x.y.z  # exact version\npackage3 &gt;= x.y.z  # at least version x.y.z\npackage4 &gt;  x.y.z  # newer than version x.y.z\npackage4 &lt;= x.y.z  # at most version x.y.z\npackage5 &lt;  x.y.z  # older than version x.y.z\npackage6 ~= x.y.z  # install version newer than x.y.z and older than x.y+1\n</code></pre> <p>In general, all packages (should) follow the semantic versioning standard, which means that the version number is split into three parts: <code>x.y.z</code> where <code>x</code> is the major version, <code>y</code> is the minor version and <code>z</code> is the patch version.</p> <p>The reason that we need to specify the version number is that we want to make sure that we can reproduce our code at a later point. If we do not specify the version number, then we are at the mercy of the package maintainer to not change the API of the package. This is especially important when working with machine learning models, as we want to make sure that we can reproduce the exact same model at a later point.</p> <p>Finally, we also need to discuss dependency resolution, which is the process of figuring out which packages are compatible. This is a non-trivial problem, and there exists a lot of different algorithms for doing this. If you have ever thought that <code>pip</code> and <code>conda</code> were taking a long time to install something, then it is probably because they were trying to figure out which packages are compatible with each other. For example, if you try to install</p> <pre><code>pip install \"matplotlib &gt;= 3.8.0\" \"numpy &lt;= 1.19\" --dry-run\n</code></pre> <p>then it would simply fail because there are no versions of <code>matplotlib</code> and <code>numpy</code> under the given constraints that are compatible with each other. In this case, we would need to relax the constraints to something like</p> <pre><code>pip install \"matplotlib &gt;= 3.8.0\" \"numpy &lt;= 1.21\" --dry-run\n</code></pre> <p>to make it work.</p>"},{"location":"s1_development_environment/package_manager/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>Conda vs. Mamba</p> <p>If you are using <code>conda</code> then you can also use <code>mamba</code> which is a drop-in replacement <code>conda</code> that is faster.

As long as all subcommands are proper documented, then our interface should be simple to interact with (again think <code>git</code> where each subcommand can be given the <code>-h</code> arg to get specific help).</p> <p>Instead of using <code>argparse</code> we are here going to look at the yyper package. <code>typer</code> extends the functionalities of <code>argparse</code> to allow for easy definition of subcommands and many other things, which we are not going to touch upon in this module. For completeness we should also mention that <code>typer</code> is not the only package for doing this, and of other excellent frameworks for creating command line interfaces easily we can mention click.</p>"},{"location":"s2_organisation_and_version_control/cli/#exercises_1","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Start by installing the <code>typer</code> package</p> <pre><code>pip install typer\n</code></pre> <p>remember to add the package to your <code>requirements.txt</code> file.</p> </li> <li> <p>To get you started with <code>typer</code>, let's just create a simple hello world type of script.

A project template is in short just an overall structure of how you want your folders, files etc. to be organized from the beginning. For this course we are going to be using a custom MLOps template. The template is essentially a fork of the cookiecutter data science template that has been used for a couple of years in the course, but specialized a bit more towards MLOps instead of general data science.</p> <p>We are not going to argue that this template is better than every other template, we are just focusing on that it is a standardized way of creating project structures for machine learning projects.

Python is the dominant language for machine learning and data science currently, which is why we in this section are focusing on some special files you will need for your Python projects.</p> <p>The first file you may or may not know is the <code>__init__.py</code> file. In Python the <code>__init__.py</code> file is used to mark a directory as a Python package. Therefore, as a bare minimum, any Python package should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>\u251c\u2500\u2500 src/\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 file1.py\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 file2.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 pyproject.toml\n</code></pre> <p>The second file to focus on is the <code>pyproject.toml</code>. This file is important for actually converting your code into a Python project. Essentially, whenever you run <code>pip install</code>, <code>pip</code> is in charge of both downloading the package you want but also in charge of installing it. For <code>pip</code> to be able to install a package it needs instructions on what part of the code it should install and how to install it. This is the job of the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p> <p>Below we have both added a description of the structure of the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file but also <code>setup.py + setup.cfg</code> which is the \"old\" way of providing project instructions regarding Python project. However, you may still encounter a lot of projects using <code>setup.py + setup.cfg</code>, so it is good to at least know about them.</p> pyproject.tomlsetup.py + setup.cfg <p><code>pyproject.toml</code> is the new standardized way of describing project metadata in a declaratively way, introduced in PEP 621. It is written in toml format which is easy to read. At the very least your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file should include the <code>[build-system]</code> and <code>[project]</code> sections:</p> <pre><code>[build-system]\nrequires = [\"setuptools\", \"wheel\"]\nbuild-backend = \"setuptools.build_meta\"\n\n[project]\nname = \"my-package-name\"\nversion = \"0.1.0\"\nauthors = [{name = \"EM\", email = \"me@em.com\"}]\ndescription = \"Something cool here.\"\nrequires-python = \"&gt;=3.8\"\ndynamic = [\"dependencies\"]\n\n[tool.setuptools.dynamic]\ndependencies = {file = [\"requirements.txt\"]}\n</code></pre> <p>the <code>[build-system]</code> informs <code>pip</code>/<code>python</code> that to build this Python project it needs the two packages <code>setuptools</code> and <code>wheels</code> and that it should call the setuptools.build_meta function to actually build the project. The <code>[project]</code> section essentially contains metadata regarding the package, what its called etc. if we ever want to publish it to PyPI.</p> <p>For specifying dependencies of your project you have two options. Either you specify them in a <code>requirements.txt</code> file and it as a dynamic field in <code>pyproject.toml</code> as shown above. Alternatively, you can add a <code>dependencies</code> field under the <code>[project]</code> header like this:</p> <pre><code>[project]\ndependencies = [\n    'torch==2.1.0',\n    'matplotlib&gt;=3.8.1'\n]\n</code></pre> <p>The improvement over <code>setup.py + setup.cfg</code> is that <code>pyproject.toml</code> also allows for metadata from other tools to be specified in it, essentially making sure you only need a single file for your project. For example, in the next [module M7 on good coding practices] you will learn about the tool <code>ruff</code> and how it can help format your code. If we want to configure <code>ruff</code> for our project we can do that directly in <code>pyproject.toml</code> by adding additional headers:</p> <pre><code>[ruff]\nruff_option = ...\n</code></pre> <p>To read more about how to specify <code>pyproject.toml</code> this page is a good place to start.</p> <p><code>setup.py</code> is the original way to describing how a Python package should be build. The most basic <code>setup.py</code> file will look like this:</p> <pre><code>from setuptools import setup\nfrom pip.req import parse_requirements\nrequirements = [str(ir.req) for ir in parse_requirements(\"requirements.txt\")]\nsetup(\n    name=\"my-package-name\",\n    version=\"0.1.0\",\n    author=\"EM\",\n    description=\"Something cool here.\"\n    install_requires=requirements,\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Essentially, the it is the exact same meta information as in <code>pyproject.toml</code>, just written directly in Python syntax instead of <code>toml</code>. Because there was a wish to deperate this meta information into a separate file, the <code>setup.cfg</code> file was created which can contain the exact same information as <code>setup.py</code> just in a declarative config.</p> <pre><code>[metadata]\nname = my-package-name\nversion = 0.1.0\nauthor = EM\ndescription = \"Something cool here.\"\n# ...\n</code></pre> <p>This non-standardized way of providing meta information regarding a package was essentially what lead to the creation of <code>pyproject.toml</code>.</p> <p>Regardless of what way a project is configured, after creating the above files, the correct way to install them would be the same</p> <pre><code>pip install .\n# or in developer mode\npip install -e .\n</code></pre> <p>Developer mode in Python</p> <p>The <code>-e</code> is short for <code>--editable</code> mode also called developer mode. Since we will continuously iterating on our package this is the preferred way to install our package, because that means that we do not have to run <code>pip install</code> every time we make a change. Essentially, in developer mode changes in the Python source code can immediately take place without requiring a new installation.</p> <p>after running this your code should be available to import as <code>from project_name import ...</code> like any other Python package you use. This is the most essential information you need to know about creating Python packages.</p>"},{"location":"s2_organisation_and_version_control/code_structure/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>After having installed cookiecutter and created your first template project (exercise 1 and 2 below), the remaining exercises are intended to be used on taking the simple CNN MNIST classifier from yesterday's exercise and force it into this structure. You are not required to fill out every folder and file in the project structure, but try to at least follow the steps in exercises. Whenever you need to run a file I recommend always doing this from the root directory e.g.</p> <pre><code>python src/&lt;project_name&gt;/data.py data/raw data/processed\npython src/&lt;project_name&gt;/train_model.py &lt;arguments&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In this way paths (for saving and loading files) are always relative to the root, and it is in general easier to wrap your head around where files are located.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Install cookiecutter framework</p> <pre><code>pip install cookiecutter\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Start a new project using this template, that is specialized for     this course (1).</p> <ol> <li>If you feel like the template can be improved in some way, feel free to either open an issue with the proposed     improvement or directly send a pull request to the repository \ud83d\ude04.</li> </ol> <p>You do this by running the cookiecutter command using the template URL:</p> <pre><code>cookiecutter &lt;url-to-template&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>Valid project names</p> <p>When asked for a project name you should follow the PEP8 guidelines for naming packages. This means that the name should be all lowercase and if you want to separate words, you should use underscores. For example <code>my_project</code> is a valid name, while <code>MyProject</code> is not. Additionally, the packaage name cannot start with a number.</p> Flat-layout vs src-layout <p>There are two common choices on how layout your source directory. The first is called src-layout where the source code is always place in a <code>src/&lt;project_name&gt;</code> folder and the second is called flat-layout where the source code is place is just placed in a <code>&lt;project_name&gt;</code> folder.

Therefore, if you     want to add a new file to the template, just add it to the <code>{{ cookiecutter.project_name }}</code> folder and make     sure to add the <code>{{ cookiecutter.&lt;variable_name&gt; }}</code> where you want the variable to be replaced.</p> </li> <li> <p>After you have made the changes you want to the template, you should test it locally.

Doing this should create a human-readable     file with the extension <code>.dvc</code>. This is the metafile as explained earlier that will serve as a placeholder for     your data. If you are on Windows and this step fails you may need to install <code>pywin32</code>. At the same time, the <code>data</code>     folder should have been added to the <code>.gitignore</code> file that marks which files should not be tracked by git. Confirm     that this is correct.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now we are going to add, commit and tag the metafiles, so we can restore to this stage later on. Commit and tag     the files, which should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>git add data.dvc .gitignore\ngit commit -m \"First datasets, containing 25000 images\"\ngit tag -a \"v1.0\" -m \"data v1.0\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Finally, push your data to the remote storage using <code>dvc push</code>. You will be asked to authenticate, which involves     copy-pasting the code in the link prompted. Check out your Google Drive folder. You will see that the data is not     in a recognizable format anymore due to the way that <code>dvc</code> packs and tracks the data. The boring detail is that     <code>dvc</code> converts the data into content-addressable storage     which makes data much faster to get. Finally, make sure that your data is not stored in your GitHub repository.</p> <p>After authenticating the first time, DVC should be setup without having to authenticate again. If you for some reason encounter that DVC fails to authenticate, you can try to reset the authentication. Locate the file <code>$CACHE_HOME/pydrive2fs/{gdrive_client_id}/default.json</code> where <code>$CACHE_HOME</code> depends on your operating system:</p> macOSLinuxWindows <p><code>~/Library/Caches</code></p> <p><code>~/.cache</code>  This is the typical location, but it may vary depending on what distro you are running</p> <p><code>{user}/AppData/Local</code></p> <p>Delete the complete <code>{gdrive_client_id}</code> folder and retry authenticating with <code>dvc push</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>After completing the above steps, it is very easy for others (or yourself) to get setup with both     code and data by simply running</p> <pre><code>git clone &lt;my_repository&gt;\ncd &lt;my_repository&gt;\ndvc pull\n</code></pre> <p>(assuming that you give them access right to the folder in your drive). Try doing this (in some other location than your standard code) to make sure that the two commands indeed download both your code and data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's now look at the process of creating a new version of our data. We are going to add some new data to our     dataset and version control this as well. The new data can be downloaded from this     Google Driver folder     or by running these two commands:</p> <pre><code>pip install gdown\ngdown --folder https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1JTjbom7IrB41Chx6uxLCN16ZwIxHHVw1?usp=sharing\n</code></pre> <p>Copy the data to your <code>data/raw</code> folder and then rerun your data pipeline to incorporate the new data into the files in your <code>processed</code> folder. The new data should are 4 files with train images and 4 files with train targets, a total of 20000 additional observations.</p> </li> <li> <p>Redo the above steps, adding the new data using <code>dvc</code>, committing and tagging the metafiles e.g. the following     commands should be executed (with appropriate input):</p> <p><code>dvc add -&gt; git add -&gt; git commit -&gt; git tag -&gt; dvc push -&gt; git push</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's say that you wanted to go back to the state of your data in v1.0. If the above steps have been done correctly,     you should be able to do this using:</p> <pre><code>git checkout v1.0\ndvc checkout\n</code></pre> <p>Confirm that you have reverted to the original data.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Finally, it is important to note that <code>dvc</code> is not only intended to be used to store data files but also     any other large files such as trained model weights (with billions of parameters these can be quite large). For     example, if we always store our best-performing model in a file called <code>best_model.ckpt</code> then we can use <code>dvc</code> to     version control it, store it online and make it easy for others to download. Feel free to experiment with this using     your model checkpoints.</p> </li> </ol> <p>In general <code>dvc</code> is a great framework for version-controlling data and models. However, it is important to note that it does have some performance issue when dealing with datasets that consist of many files. Therefore, if you are ever working with a dataset that consists of many small files, it can be a good idea to:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Zip files into a single archive and then version control the archive. The <code>zip</code> archive should be placed in a     <code>data/raw</code> folder and then unzipped in the <code>data/processed</code> folder.</p> </li> <li> <p>If possible turn your data into 1D arrays, then it can be stored in a single file such as <code>.parquet</code> or <code>.csv</code>.     This is especially useful for tabular data. Then you can version control the single file instead of the many files.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"s2_organisation_and_version_control/dvc/#knowledge-check","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Knowledge check","text":"<ol> <li> <p>How do you know that a repository is using dvc?</p> Solution <p>Similar to a git repository having a <code>.git</code> directory, a repository using dvc needs to have a <code>.dvc</code> folder.

For this exercise you will     go through the steps of sending an open-source contribution:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Go online and find a project you do not own, where you can improve the code. You can either look at this     page of good issues to get started with or for simplicity you can just choose     the repository belonging to the course.

It is good practice to make a new branch when working on some changes. Use     the <code>git branch</code> command followed by the <code>git checkout</code> command to create a new branch.</p> </li> <li> <p>You are now ready to make changes to the repository. Try to find something to improve (any spelling mistakes?).     When you have made the changes, do the standard git cycle: <code>add -&gt; commit -&gt; push</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Go online to the original repository and go to the <code>Pull requests</code> tab. Find <code>compare</code> button and     choose the button to compare the <code>master branch</code> of the original repo with the branch that you just created     in your own repository.

Locally make changes to the same     file in the same lines and commit them afterwards.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now try to <code>git pull</code> the online changes. What should (hopefully) happen is that git will tell you that it found     a merge conflict that needs to be resolved. Open the file and you should see something like this</p> <pre><code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD\nthis is some content to mess with\ncontent to append\n=======\ntotally different content to merge later\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; master\n</code></pre> <p>this should be interpreted as: everything that's between <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code> and <code>=======</code> are the changes made by your local commit and everything between <code>=======</code> and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> are the changes you are trying to pull.

Lets try to configure <code>ruff</code> using the <code>pyproject.toml</code> file.</p> <ol> <li> <p>One aspect that is not covered by PEP8 is how <code>import</code> statements in Python should be organized. If you are like     most people, you place your <code>import</code> statements at the top of the file and they are ordered simply by when you     needed them. A better practice is to introduce some clear structure in our imports. In older versions of this course     we have used isort to do the job, but we are here going to configure <code>ruff</code> to do     the job.

If you code consist of multiple levels of indentation, you can     quickly run into 79 characters being limiting. For this reason many projects increase it, often to 120 characters     which seems to be the sweet spot of how many characters fits in a coding window on a laptop.

Typing goes back to the earlier programming languages like <code>c</code>, <code>c++</code> etc. where data types needed to be explicit stated for variables:</p> <pre><code>int main() {\n    int x = 5 + 6;\n    float y = 0.5;\n    cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello World! \" &lt;&lt; x &lt;&lt; std::endl();\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is not required by Python but it can really improve the readability of code, that you can directly read from the code what the expected types of input arguments and returns are. In Python the <code>:</code> character have been reserved for type hints. Here is one example of adding typing to a function:</p> <pre><code>def add2(x: int, y: int) -&gt; int:\n    return x+y\n</code></pre> <p>here we mark that both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are integers and using the arrow notation <code>-&gt;</code> we mark that the output type is also an integer. Assuming that we are also going to use the function for floats and <code>torch.Tensor</code>s we could improve the typing by specifying a union of types. Depending on the version of Python you are using the syntax for this can be different.</p> python &lt;3.10python &gt;=3.10 <pre><code>from torch import Tensor  # note it is Tensor with upper case T. This is the base class of all tensors\nfrom typing import Union\ndef add2(x: Union[int, float, Tensor], y: Union[int, float, Tensor]) -&gt; Union[int, float, Tensor]:\n    return x+y\n</code></pre> <pre><code>from torch import Tensor  # note it is Tensor with upper case T.

In general, a hyperparameter is any parameter that affects the learning process (e.g. the weights of a neural network are not hyperparameters because they are a consequence of the learning process). The problem with having many hyperparameters to control in your code, is that if you are not careful and structure them it may be hard after running a experiment to figure out which hyperparameters were actually used. Lack of proper configuration management can cause serious problems with reliability, uptime, and the ability to scale a system.</p> <p>One of the most basic ways of structuring hyperparameters, is just to put them directly into you <code>train.py</code> script in some object:</p> <pre><code>class my_hp:\n    batch_size: 64\n    lr: 128\n    other_hp: 12345\n\n# easy access to them\ndl = DataLoader(Dataset, batch_size=my_hp.batch_size)\n</code></pre> <p>the problem here is configuration is not easy. Each time you want to run a new experiment, you basically have to change the script. If you run the code multiple times, without committing the changes in between then the exact hyperparameter configuration for some experiments may be lost. Alright, with this in mind you change strategy to use an argument parser e.g. run experiments like this</p> <pre><code>python train.py --batch_size 256 --learning_rate 1e-4 --other_hp 12345\n</code></pre> <p>This at least solves the problem with configurability. However, we again can end up with losing experiments if we are not careful.</p> <p>What we really want is some way to easily configure our experiments where the hyperparameters are systematically saved with the experiment. For this we turn our attention to Hydra, a configuration tool that is based around writing config files to keep track of hyperparameters. Hydra operates on top of OmegaConf which is a <code>yaml</code> based hierarchical configuration system.</p> <p>A simple <code>yaml</code> configuration file could look like</p> <pre><code>#config.yaml\nhyperparameters:\n  batch_size: 64\n  learning_rate: 1e-4\n</code></pre> <p>with the corresponding Python code for loading the file</p> <pre><code>from omegaconf import OmegaConf\n# loading\nconfig = OmegaConf.load('config.yaml')\n\n# accessing in two different ways\ndl = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=config.hyperparameters.batch_size)\noptimizer = torch.optim.Adam(model.parameters(), lr=config['hyperparameters']['learning_rate'])\n</code></pre> <p>or using <code>hydra</code> for loading the configuration</p> <pre><code>import hydra\n\n@hydra.main(config_name=\"basic.yaml\")\ndef main(cfg):\n    print(cfg.hyperparameters.batch_size, cfg.hyperparameters.learning_rate)\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n</code></pre> <p>The idea behind refactoring our hyperparameters into <code>.yaml</code> files is that we disentangle the model configuration from the model.

Please make sure that you somewhat understand each step and do not just copy the exercise. Also, note that you probably need to execute the exercise from an elevated terminal e.g. with administrative privilege.</p> <p>The exercises today are only an introduction to docker and some of the steps are going to be unoptimized from a production setting view. For example, we often want to keep the size of the docker image as small as possible, which we are not focusing on for these exercises.</p> <p>If you are using <code>VScode</code> then we recommend installing the VScode docker extension for easy getting an overview of which images have been building and which are running. Additionally, the extension named Dev Containers may also be beneficial for you to download.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by installing docker. How much trouble you need to go through     depends on your operating system. For Windows and Mac, we recommend they install Docker Desktop, which comes with     a graphical user interface (GUI) for quickly viewing docker images and docker containers currently built/in use.     Windows users that have not installed WSL yet are going to have to do it now (as docker needs it as a backend for     starting virtual machines) but you do not need to install docker in WSL. After installing docker we recommend that     you restart your laptop.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try running the following to confirm that your installation is working:</p> <pre><code>docker run hello-world\n</code></pre> <p>which should give the message</p> <pre><code>Hello from Docker!\nThis message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Next, let's try to download an image from Docker Hub. Download the <code>busybox</code> image:</p> <pre><code>docker pull busybox\n</code></pre> <p>which is a very small (1-5Mb) containerized application that contains the most essential GNU file utilities, shell utilities, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>After pulling the image, write</p> <pre><code>docker images\n</code></pre> <p>which should show you all available images. You should see the <code>busybox</code> image that we just downloaded.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's try to run this image</p> <pre><code>docker run busybox\n</code></pre> <p>You will see that nothing happens! The reason for that is we did not provide any commands to <code>docker run</code>. We essentially just ask it to start the <code>busybox</code> virtual machine, do nothing, and then close it again. Now, try again, this time with</p> <pre><code>docker run busybox echo \"hello from busybox\"\n</code></pre> <p>Note how fast this process is. In just a few seconds, Docker is able to start a virtual machine, execute a command, and kill it afterward.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try running</p> <pre><code>docker ps\n</code></pre> <p>What does this command do? What if you add <code>-a</code> to the end?</p> </li> <li> <p>If we want to run multiple commands within the virtual machine, we can start it in interactive mode</p> <pre><code>docker run -it busybox\n</code></pre> <p>This can be a great way to investigate what the filesystem of our virtual machine looks like.</p> </li> <li> <p>As you may have already noticed by now, each time we execute <code>docker run</code>, we can still see small remnants of the     containers using <code>docker ps -a</code>. These stray containers can end up taking up a lot of disk space. To remove them,     use <code>docker rm</code> where you provide the container ID that you want to delete</p> <pre><code>docker rm &lt;container_id&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>In general we recommend to use the <code>--rm</code> flag when running a container e.g.</p> <pre><code>docker run --rm &lt;image&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>which will automatically remove the container after it has finished running.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's now move on to trying to construct a Dockerfile ourselves for our MNIST project. Create a file called     <code>trainer.dockerfile</code>. The intention is that we want to develop one Dockerfile for running our training script and     one for doing predictions.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead of starting from scratch, we nearly always want to start from some base image. For this exercise, we are     going to start from a simple <code>python</code> image. Add the following to your <code>Dockerfile</code></p> <pre><code># Base image\nFROM python:3.9-slim\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Next, we are going to install some essentials in our image. The essentials more or less consist of a Python     installation. These instructions may seem familiar if you are using Linux:</p> <pre><code># Install Python\nRUN apt update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential gcc &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The previous two steps are common for any Docker application where you want to run Python. All the remaining steps     are application-specific (to some degree):</p> <ol> <li> <p>Let's copy over our application (the essential parts) from our computer to the container:</p> <pre><code>COPY requirements.txt requirements.txt\nCOPY pyproject.toml pyproject.toml\nCOPY &lt;project-name&gt;/ &lt;project-name&gt;/\nCOPY data/ data/\n</code></pre> <p>Remember that we only want the essential parts to keep our Docker image as small as possible. Why do we need each of these files/folders to run training in our Docker container?</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's set the working directory in our container and add commands that install the dependencies (1):</p> <ol> <li> <p> We split the installation into two steps so that Docker can cache our project dependencies     separately from our application code. This means that if we change our application code, we do not need to     reinstall all the dependencies. This is a common strategy for Docker images.</p> <p> As an alternative, you can use <code>RUN make requirements</code> if you have a <code>Makefile</code> that installs the dependencies. Just remember to also copy over the <code>Makefile</code> into the Docker image.</p> </li> </ol> <pre><code>WORKDIR /\nRUN pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir\nRUN pip install . --no-deps --no-cache-dir\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>--no-cache-dir</code> is quite important. Can you explain what it does and why it is important in relation to Docker?</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we are going to name our training script as the entrypoint for our Docker image. The entrypoint is     the application that we want to run when the image is being executed:</p> <pre><code>ENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"-u\", \"&lt;project_name&gt;/train_model.py\"]\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>\"u\"</code> here makes sure that any output from our script, e.g., any <code>print(...)</code> statements, gets redirected to our terminal. If not included, you would need to use <code>docker logs</code> to inspect your run.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>We are now ready to build our Dockerfile into a Docker image.</p> <pre><code>docker build -f trainer.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest\n</code></pre> MAC M1/M2 users <p>In general, Docker images are built for a specific platform. For example, if you are using a Mac with an M1/M2 chip, then you are running on an ARM architecture. If you are using a Windows or Linux machine, then you are running on an AMD64 architecture. This is important to know when building Docker images. Thus, Docker images you build may not work on other platforms than the ones you build on. You can specify which platform you want to build for by adding the <code>--platform</code> argument to the <code>docker build</code> command:</p> <pre><code>docker build --platform linux/amd64 -f trainer.dockerfile . -t trainer:latest\n</code></pre> <p>and also when running the image:</p> <pre><code>docker run --platform linux/amd64 trainer:latest\n</code></pre> <p>Note that this will significantly increase the build and run time of your Docker image when running locally, because Docker will need to emulate the other platform. In general, for the exercises today, you should not need to specify the platform, but be aware of this if you are building Docker images on your own.</p> <p>Please note that here we are providing two extra arguments to <code>docker build</code>. The <code>-f trainer.dockerfile .</code> (the dot is important to remember) indicates which Dockerfile we want to run (except if you named it just <code>Dockerfile</code>) and the <code>-t trainer:latest</code> is the respective name and tag that we see afterward when running <code>docker images</code> (see image below). Please note that building a Docker image can take a couple of minutes.</p> <p> </p> Docker images and space <p>Docker images can take up a lot of space on your computer, especially the Docker images we are trying to build because PyTorch is a huge dependency. If you are running low on space, you can try to</p> <pre><code>docker system prune\n</code></pre> <p>Alternatively, you can manually delete images using <code>docker rmi {image_name}:{image_tag}</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try running <code>docker images</code> and confirm that you get output similar to the one above. If you succeed with this,     then try running the docker image</p> <pre><code>docker run --name experiment1 trainer:latest\n</code></pre> <p>you should hopefully see your training starting. Please note that we can start as many containers as we want at the same time by giving them all different names using the <code>--name</code> tag.</p> <ol> <li> <p>You are most likely going to rebuild your Docker image multiple times, either due to an implementation error     or the addition of new functionality. Therefore, instead of watching pip suffer through downloading <code>torch</code> for     the 20th time, you can reuse the cache from the last time the Docker image was built. To do this, replace the line     in your Dockerfile that installs your requirements with:</p> <pre><code>RUN --mount=type=cache,target=~/pip/.cache pip install -r requirements.txt --no-cache-dir\n</code></pre> <p>which mounts your local pip cache to the Docker image. For building the image, you need to have enabled the BuildKit feature. If you have Docker version v23.0 or later (you can check this by running <code>docker version</code>), then this is enabled by default. Otherwise, you need to enable it by setting the environment variable <code>DOCKER_BUILDKIT=1</code> before building the image.</p> <p>Try changing your Dockerfile and rebuilding the image. You should see that the build process is much faster.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Remember, if you ever are in doubt about how files are organized inside a Docker image, you always have the option     to start the image in interactive mode:</p> <pre><code>docker run --rm -it --entrypoint sh {image_name}:{image_tag}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>When your training has completed you will notice that any files that are created when running your training script     are not present on your laptop (for example if your script is saving the trained model to a file). This is because     the files were created inside your container (which is a separate little machine). To get the files you have two     options:</p> <ol> <li> <p>If you already have a completed run then you can use it</p> <pre><code>docker cp\n</code></pre> <p>to copy the files between your container and laptop. For example to copy a file called <code>trained_model.pt</code> from a folder you would do:</p> <pre><code>docker cp {container_name}:{dir_path}/{file_name} {local_dir_path}/{local_file_name}\n</code></pre> <p>Try this out.</p> </li> <li> <p>A much more efficient strategy is to mount a volume that is shared between the host (your laptop) and the     container. This can be done with the <code>-v</code> option for the <code>docker run</code> command. For example, if we want to     automatically get the <code>trained_model.pt</code> file after running our training script we could simply execute the     container as</p> <pre><code>docker run --name {container_name} -v %cd%/models:/models/ trainer:latest\n</code></pre> <p>this command mounts our local <code>models</code> folder as a corresponding <code>models</code> folder in the container. Any file save by the container to this folder will be synchronized back to our host machine. Try this out! Note if you have multiple files/folders that you want to mount (if in doubt about file organization in the container try to do the next exercise first). Also note that the <code>%cd%</code> needs to change depending on your OS, see this page for help.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>With training done we also need to write an application for prediction. Create a new docker image called     <code>predict.dockerfile</code>. This file should call your <code>&lt;project_name&gt;/models/predict_model.py</code> script instead. This image     will need some trained model weights to work. Feel free to either include these during the build process or mount     them afterwards. When you create the file try to <code>build</code> and <code>run</code> it to confirm that it works. Hint: if     you are passing in the model checkpoint and prediction data as arguments to your script, your <code>docker run</code> probably     needs to look something like</p> <pre><code>docker run --name predict --rm \\\n    -v %cd%/trained_model.pt:/models/trained_model.pt \\  # mount trained model file\n    -v %cd%/data/example_images.npy:/example_images.npy \\  # mount data we want to predict on\n    predict:latest \\\n    ../../models/trained_model.pt \\  # argument to script, path relative to script location in container\n    ../../example_images.npy\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>(Optional, requires GPU support) By default, a virtual machine created by docker only has access to your <code>cpu</code> and     not your <code>gpu</code>. While you do not necessarily have a laptop with a GPU that supports the training of neural networks     (e.g. one from Nvidia) it is beneficial that you understand how to construct a docker image that can take advantage     of a GPU if you were to run this on a machine in the future that has a GPU (e.g. in the cloud). It does take a bit     more work, but many of the steps will be similar to building a normal docker image.</p> <ol> <li> <p>There are three prerequisites for working with Nvidia GPU-accelerated docker containers. First, you need to have     the Docker Engine installed (already taken care of), have Nvidia GPU with updated GPU drivers and finally have     the Nvidia container toolkit     installed. The last part you not likely have not installed and needs to do. Some distros of Linux have known     problems with the installation process, so you may have to search through known issues in     nvidia-docker repository to find a solution</p> </li> <li> <p>To test that everything is working start by pulling a relevant Nvidia docker image. In my case this is     the correct image:</p> <pre><code>docker pull nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-base-ubuntu20.04\n</code></pre> <p>but it may differ based on what Cuda vision you have. You can find all the different official Nvidia images here. After pulling the image, try running the <code>nvidia-smi</code> command inside a container based on the image you just pulled. It should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>docker run --rm --gpus all nvidia/cuda:11.0.3-base-ubuntu20.04 nvidia-smi\n</code></pre> <p>and should show an image like below:</p> <p> </p> <p>If it does not work, try redoing the steps.</p> </li> <li> <p>We should hopefully have a working setup now for running Nvidia accelerated docker containers. The next step is     to get PyTorch inside our container, such that our PyTorch implementation also correctly identifies the GPU.     Luckily for us, Nvidia provides a set of docker images for GPU-optimized software for AI, HPC and visualizations     through their NGC Catalog.     The containers that have to do with PyTorch can be seen     here. Try pulling the latest:</p> <pre><code>docker pull nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.07-py3\n</code></pre> <p>It may take some time because the NGC images include a lot of other software for optimizing PyTorch applications. It may be possible for you to find other images for running GPU-accelerated applications that have a smaller memory footprint, but NGC is the recommended and supported way.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's test that this container works:</p> <pre><code>docker run --gpus all -it --rm nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.07-py3\n</code></pre> <p>this should run the container in interactive mode attached to your current terminal. Try opening <code>python</code> in the container and try writing:</p> <pre><code>import torch\nprint(torch.cuda.is_available())\n</code></pre> <p>which hopefully should return <code>True</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we need to incorporate all this into our already developed docker files for our application. This is     also fairly easy as we just need to change our <code>FROM</code> statement at the beginning of our docker file:</p> <pre><code>FROM python:3.7-slim\n</code></pre> <p>change to</p> <pre><code>FROM  nvcr.io/nvidia/pytorch:22.07-py3\n</code></pre> <p>try doing this to one of your docker files, build the image and run the container. Remember to check that your application is using GPU by printing <code>torch.cuda.is_available()</code>.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Another way you can use Dockerfiles in your day-to-day work is for Dev-containers. Developer containers     allow you to develop code directly inside a container, making sure that your code is running in the same     environment as it will when deployed. This is especially useful if you are working on a project that has a lot of     dependencies that are hard to install on your local machine. Setup instructions for VS Code and PyCharm can be found     here (should be simple since we have already installed Docker):</p> <ul> <li>VS Code</li> <li>PyCharm</li> </ul> <p>We will focus on the VS Code setup here.</p> <ol> <li> <p>First, install the     Remote - Containers     extension.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a <code>.devcontainer</code> folder in your project root and create a <code>Dockerfile</code> inside it. We will keep this file very     barebones for now, so let's just define a base installation of Python:</p> <pre><code>FROM python:3.11-slim-buster\n\nRUN apt update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential gcc &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Create a <code>devcontainer.json</code> file in the <code>.devcontainer</code> folder. This file should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"my_working_env\",\n    \"dockerFile\": \"Dockerfile\",\n    \"postCreateCommand\": \"pip install -r requirements.txt\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This file tells VS Code that we want to use the <code>Dockerfile</code> that we just created and that we want to install our Python dependencies after the container has been created.</p> </li> <li> <p>After creating these files, you should be able to open the command palette in VS Code (F1) and search for the     option <code>Remote-Containers: Reopen in Container</code> or <code>Remote-Containers: Rebuild and Reopen in Container</code>. Choose     either of these options.</p> <p> </p> <p>This will start a new VS Code instance inside a Docker container. You should be able to see this in the bottom left corner of your VS Code window. You should also be able to see that the Python interpreter has changed to the one inside the container.</p> <p>You are now ready to start developing inside the container. Try opening a terminal and run <code>python</code> and <code>import torch</code> to confirm that everything is working.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) In M8 on Data version control you learned about the     framework <code>dvc</code> for version controlling data. A neutral question at this point would then be how to incorporate     <code>dvc</code> into our docker image. We need to do two things:</p> <ul> <li>Make sure that <code>dvc</code> has all the correct files to pull data from our remote storage</li> <li>Make sure that <code>dvc</code> has the correct credentials to pull data from our remote storage</li> </ul> <p>We are going to assume that <code>dvc</code> (and any <code>dvc</code> extension needed) is part of your <code>requirements.txt</code> file and that it is already being installed in a <code>RUN pip install -r requirements.txt</code> command in your Dockerfile. If not, then you need to add it.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Add the following lines to your Dockerfile</p> <pre><code>RUN dvc init --no-scm\nCOPY .dvc/config .dvc/config\nCOPY *.dvc .dvc/\nRUN dvc config core.no_scm true\nRUN dvc pull\n</code></pre> <p>The first line initializes <code>dvc</code> in the Docker image. The <code>--no-scm</code> option is needed because normally <code>dvc</code> can only be initialized inside a git repository, but this option allows initializing <code>dvc</code> without being in one. The second and third lines copy over the <code>dvc</code> config file and the <code>dvc</code> metadata files that are needed to pull data from your remote storage. The last line pulls the data.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your data is not public, we need to provide credentials in some way to pull the data. We are for now going to     do it in a not-so-secure way. When <code>dvc</code> first connected to your drive, a credential file was created. This file     is located in <code>$CACHE_HOME/pydrive2fs/{gdrive_client_id}/default.json</code> where <code>$CACHE_HOME</code>.</p> macOSLinuxWindows <p><code>~/Library/Caches</code></p> <p><code>~/.cache</code>  This is the typical location, but it may vary depending on what distro you are running.</p> <p><code>{user}/AppData/Local</code></p> <p>Find the file. The content should look similar to this (only some fields are shown):</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"access_token\": ...,\n    \"client_id\": ...,\n    \"client_secret\": ...,\n    \"refresh_token\": ...,\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre> <p>We are going to copy the file into our Docker image. This, of course, is not a secure way of doing it, but it is the easiest way to get started. As long as you are not sharing your Docker image with anyone else, then it is fine. Add the following lines to your Dockerfile before the <code>RUN dvc pull</code> command:</p> <pre><code>COPY &lt;path_to_default.json&gt; default.json\ndvc remote modify myremote --local gdrive_service_account_json_file_path default.json\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>&lt;path_to_default.json&gt;</code> is the path to the <code>default.json</code> file that you just found. The last line tells <code>dvc</code> to use the <code>default.json</code> file as the credentials for pulling data from your remote storage. You can confirm that this works by running <code>dvc pull</code> in your Docker image.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"s3_reproducibility/docker/#knowledge-check","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Knowledge check","text":"<ol> <li> <p>What is the difference between a docker image and a docker container?</p> Solution <p>A Docker image is a template for a Docker container.

This should be clear if     you look at the output when building a Docker image. What is the advantage of this?</p> Solution <p>The advantage is efficiency and reusability. When a change is made to a Docker image, only the layer(s) that are changed need to be updated. For example, if you update the application code in your Docker image, which usually is the last layer, then only that layer needs to be rebuilt, making the process much faster. Additionally, if you have multiple Docker images that share the same base image, then the base image only needs to be downloaded once.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This covers the absolute minimum you should know about Docker to get a working image and container. If you want to really deep dive into this topic, you can find a copy of the Docker Cookbook by S\u00e9bastien Goasguen in the literature folder.</p> <p>If you are actively going to be using Docker in the future, one thing to consider is the image size. Even these simple images that we have built still take up GB in size. Several optimization steps can be taken to reduce the image size for you or your end user. If you have time, you can read this article on different approaches to reducing image size.

If you have already tried doing a couple of projects within machine learning you will probably have seen a pattern: every project usually consist of these three aspects of code:</p> <ul> <li>a model implementation</li> <li>some training code</li> <li>a collection of utilities for saving models, logging images etc.</li> </ul> <p>While the latter two certainly seems important, in most cases the actual development or research often revolves around defining the model. In this sense, both the training code and the utilities becomes boilerplate that should just carry over from one project to another. But the problem usually is that we have not generalized our training code to take care of the small adjusted that may be required in future projects and we therefore end up implementing it over and over again every time that we start a new project. This is of course a waste of our time that we should try to find a solution to.</p> <p>This is where high-level frameworks comes into play. High-level frameworks are build on top of another framework (PyTorch in this case) and tries to abstract/standardize how to do particular tasks such as training. At first it may seem irritating that you need to comply to someone else code structure, however there is a good reason for that.

Similarly, the flags <code>min_epochs</code>, <code>min_steps</code> and <code>min_time</code> can be used to set the minimum number of epochs, steps or time.</p> </li> <li> <p>To start with we also want to limit the amount of training data to 20% of its original size. which     trainer flag do you need to set for this to work?</p> Solution <p>Setting the <code>limit_train_batches</code> flag will accomplish this.</p> <pre><code>trainer = Trainer(limit_train_batches=0.2)\n</code></pre> <p>Similarly, you can also set the <code>limit_val_batches</code> and <code>limit_test_batches</code> flags to limit the validation and test data.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Try fitting your model: <code>trainer.fit(model)</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Now try adding some <code>callbacks</code> to your trainer.</p> Solution <pre><code>early_stopping_callback = EarlyStopping(\n    monitor=\"val_loss\", patience=3, verbose=True, mode=\"min\"\n)\ncheckpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(\n    dirpath=\"./models\", monitor=\"val_loss\", mode=\"min\"\n)\ntrainer = Trainer(callbacks=[early_stopping_callback, checkpoint_callback])\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The privous module was all about logging in <code>wandb</code>, so the question is naturally how does <code>lightning</code> support this.     Lightning does not only support <code>wandb</code>, but also many     others. Common for all of them, is that     logging just need to happen through the <code>self.log</code> method in your <code>LightningModule</code>:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Add <code>self.log</code> to your `LightningModule. Should look something like this:</p> <pre><code>def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n    data, target = batch\n    preds = self(data)\n    loss = self.criterion(preds, target)\n    acc = (target == preds.argmax(dim=-1)).float().mean()\n    self.log('train_loss', loss)\n    self.log('train_acc', acc)\n    return loss\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Add the <code>wandb</code> logger to your trainer</p> <pre><code>trainer = Trainer(logger=pl.loggers.WandbLogger(project=\"dtu_mlops\"))\n</code></pre> <p>and try to train the model. Confirm that you are seeing the scalars appearing in your <code>wandb</code> portal.</p> </li> <li> <p><code>self.log</code> does sadly only support logging scalar tensors. Luckily, for logging other quantities we     can still access the standard <code>wandb.log</code> through our model</p> <pre><code>def training_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n    ...\n    # self.logger.experiment is the same as wandb.log\n    self.logger.experiment.log({'logits': wandb.Histrogram(preds)})\n</code></pre> <p>try doing this, by logging something else than scalar tensors.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we maybe also want to do some validation or testing. In lightning we just need to add the <code>validation_step</code>     and <code>test_step</code> to our lightning module and supply the respective data in form of a separate dataloader. Try to at     least implement one of them.</p> Solution <p>Both validation and test steps can be implemented in the same way as the training step:</p> <pre><code>def validation_step(self, batch) -&gt; None:\n    data, target = batch\n    preds = self(data)\n    loss = self.criterion(preds, target)\n    acc = (target == preds.argmax(dim=-1)).float().mean()\n    self.log('val_loss', loss, on_epoch=True)\n    self.log('val_acc', acc, on_epoch=True)\n</code></pre> <p>two things to take note of here is that we are setting the <code>on_epoch</code> flag to <code>True</code> in the <code>self.log</code> method. This is because we want to log the validation loss and accuracy only once per epoch. Additionally, we are not returning anything from the <code>validation_step</code> method, because we do not optimize over the loss.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional, requires GPU) One of the big advantages of using <code>lightning</code> is that you no more need to deal with device     placement e.g. called <code>.to('cuda')</code> everywhere. If you have a GPU, try to set the <code>gpus</code> flag in the trainer. If you     do not have one, do not worry, we are going to return to this when we are going to run training in the cloud.</p> Solution <p>The two arguments <code>accelerator</code> and <code>devices</code> can be used to specify which devices to run on and how many to run on. For example, to run on a single GPU you can do</p> <pre><code>trainer = Trainer(accelerator=\"gpu\", devices=1)\n</code></pre> <p>as an alternative the accelerator can just be set to <code>accelerator=\"auto\"</code> to automatically detect the best available device.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) As default PyTorch uses <code>float32</code> for representing floating point numbers. However, research have shown     that neural network training is very robust towards a decrease in precision. The great benefit going from <code>float32</code>     to <code>float16</code> is that we get approximately half the     memory consumption. Try out half-precision     training in PyTorch lightning. You can enable this by setting the     precision flag in the <code>Trainer</code>.</p> Solution <p>Lightning supports four different types of mixed precision training (16-bit and 16-bit bfloat) and two types of:</p> <pre><code># 16-bit mixed precision (model weights remain in torch.float32)\ntrainer = Trainer(precision=\"16-mixed\", devices=1)\n\n# 16-bit bfloat mixed precision (model weights remain in torch.float32)\ntrainer = Trainer(precision=\"bf16-mixed\", devices=1)\n\n# 16-bit precision (model weights get cast to torch.float16)\ntrainer = Trainer(precision=\"16-true\", devices=1)\n\n# 16-bit bfloat precision (model weights get cast to torch.bfloat16)\ntrainer = Trainer(precision=\"bf16-true\", devices=1)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Lightning also have built-in support for profiling. Checkout how to do this using the     profiler argument in     the <code>Trainer</code> object.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Another great feature of Lightning is that the allow for easily defining command line interfaces through     the Lightning CLI feature. The     Lightning CLI is essentially a drop in replacement for defining command line interfaces (covered in     this module) and can also replace the need for config files     (covered in this module) for securing reproducibility when working inside     the Lightning framework. We highly recommend checking out the feature and that you try to refactor your code such     that you do not need to call <code>trainer.fit</code> anymore but it is instead directly controlled from the Lightning CLI.</p> </li> <li> <p>Free exercise: Experiment with what the lightning framework is capable of. Either try out more of the trainer flags,     some of the other callbacks, or maybe look into some of the other methods that can be implemented in your lightning     module. Only your imagination is the limit!</p> </li> </ol> <p>That covers everything for today. It has been a mix of topics that all should help you write \"better\" code (by some objective measure).

We could even change the print to include something like <code>batch.shape</code> to also have information about the current data being processed. Using <code>print</code> statements is fine for small applications, but to have proper logging we need a bit more functionality than what <code>print</code> can offer. Python actually comes with a great logging module, that defines functions for flexible logging. However, it does require a bit more setup than just using <code>print</code>:</p> <pre><code>import logging\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nlogger.setLevel(logging.INFO)\nlogger.info(\"This is an info message\")\n</code></pre> <p>For this reason we are instead going to look at loguru package which makes Python logging (stupidly) easy.

Levels essentially allows of to get rid of statements like this:</p> <pre><code>if debug:\n    print(x.shape)\n</code></pre> <p>where the logging is conditional on the variable <code>debug</code> which we can set a runtime. Thus, it is something we can disable for users of our application (<code>debug=False</code>) but have enabled when we develop the application (<code>debug=True</code>). And it makes sense that not all things logged, should be available to all stakeholders of a codebase. We as developers probably always wants the highest level of logging, whereas users of our code need less info, and we may want to differentiate this based on users.</p> <p></p> <p>It is also important to understand the different between logging and error handling. Error handling Python is done using <code>raise</code> statements and <code>try/catch</code> like:</p> <pre><code>def f(x: int):\n    if not isinstance(x, int):\n        raise ValueError(\"Expected an integer\")\n    return 2 * x\n\ntry:\n    f(5):\nexcept ValueError:\n    print(\"I failed to do a thing, but continuing.\")\n</code></pre> <p>Why would we ever need log <code>warning</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>critical</code> levels of information, if we are just going to handle it? The reason is that raising exceptions are meant to change the program flow at runtime e.g. things we do not want the user to do, but we can deal with in some way. Logging is always for after a program have run, to inspect what went wrong. Sometimes you need one, sometimes the other, sometimes both.</p>"},{"location":"s4_debugging_and_logging/logging/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>If in doubt, always refer to the documentation for help.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by installing <code>loguru</code>:</p> <pre><code>pip install loguru\n</code></pre> <p>and remember to add to your requirements file.</p> </li> <li> <p>Create a script called <code>my_logger.py</code> and try logging a few messages using <code>loguru</code>.

Being able to track and log experiments is an important part of understanding what is going on with your model while you are training.

Without proper logging of experiments, it can be really hard to iterate on the model because you do not know what changes lead to increase or decrease in performance.</p> <p>The most basic logging we can do when running experiments is writing the metrics that our model is producing e.g. the loss or the accuracy to the terminal or a file for later inspection. We can then also use tools such as matplotlib for plotting the progression of our metrics over time.

It will come in handy for your group work as they essentially allows multiple users to upload their own runs to the same project in <code>wandb</code>.</p> Solution <p>Relevant documentation can be found here. The <code>project</code> indicates what project all experiments and artifacts are logged to. We want to keep this the same for all group members. The <code>entity</code> is the username of the person or team who owns the project, which should also be the same for all group members. The job type is important if you have different jobs that log to the same project. A common example is one script that trains a model and another that evaluates it. By setting the job type you can easily filter the runs in the wandb dashboard.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Wandb also comes with build in feature for doing hyperparameter sweeping     which can be beneficial to get a better working model. Look through the documentation on how to do a hyperparameter     sweep in Wandb. You at least need to create a new file called <code>sweep.yaml</code> and make sure that you call <code>wandb.log</code>     in your code on an appropriate value.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by creating a <code>sweep.yaml</code> file. Relevant documentation can be found     here. We recommend placing the file in a     <code>configs</code> folder in your project.</p> Solution <p>The <code>sweep.yaml</code> file will depend on kind of hyperparameters your model accepts as arguments and how they are passed to the model. For this solution we assume that the model accepts the hyperparameters <code>lr</code>, <code>batch_size</code> and <code>epochs</code> and that they are passed as <code>--args</code> (with hyphens) (1) e.g. this would be how we run the script</p> <ol> <li> If the script you want to run hyperparameter sweeping is configured using     hydra then you will need to change the default <code>command</code> config     in your <code>sweep.yaml</code> file. This is because <code>wandb</code> uses <code>--args</code> to pass hyperparameters to the script,     whereas <code>hydra</code> uses <code>args</code> (without the hyphen). See this     page for more information.</li> </ol> <pre><code>python train.py --lr=0.01 --batch_size=32 --epochs=10\n</code></pre> <p>The <code>sweep.yaml</code> could then look like this:</p> <pre><code>program: train.py\nname: sweepdemo\nproject: my_project  # change this\nentity: my_entity  # change this\nmetric:\n    goal: minimize\n    name: validation_loss\nparameters:\n    learning_rate:\n        min: 0.0001\n        max: 0.1\n        distribution: log_uniform\n    batch_size:\n        values: [16, 32, 64]\n    epochs:\n        values: [5, 10, 15]\nrun_cap: 10\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Afterwards, you need to create a sweep using the <code>wandb sweep</code> command:</p> <pre><code>wandb sweep configs/sweep.yaml\n</code></pre> <p>this will output a sweep id that you need to use in the next step.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, you need to run the sweep using the <code>wandb agent</code> command:</p> <pre><code>wandb agent &lt;sweep_id&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>&lt;sweep_id&gt;</code> is the id of the sweep you just created. You can find the id in the output of the <code>wandb sweep</code> command. The reason that we first lunch the sweep and then the agent is that we can have multiple agents running at the same time, parallelizing the search for the best hyperparameters. Try this out by opening a new terminal and running the <code>wandb agent</code> command again (with the same <code>&lt;sweep_id&gt;</code>).</p> </li> <li> <p>Inspect the sweep results in the wandb dashboard. You should see multiple new runs under the project you are     logging the sweep to, corresponding to the different hyperparameters you tried. Make sure you understand the     results and can answer what hyperparameters gave the best results and what hyperparameters had the largest     impact on the results.</p> Solution <p>In the sweep dashboard you should see something like this:</p> <p> </p> <p>Importantly you can:</p> <ol> <li>Sort the runs based on what metric you are interested in, thereby quickly finding the best runs.</li> <li>Look at the parallel coordinates plot to see if there are any tendencies in the hyperparameters that     gives the best results.</li> <li>Look at the importance/correlation plot to see what hyperparameters have the largest impact on the     results.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Next we need to understand the model registry, which will be very important later on when we get to the deployment     of our models. The model registry is a centralized place for storing and versioning models. Importantly, any model     in the registry is immutable, meaning that once a model is uploaded it cannot be changed. This is important for     reproducibility and traceability of models.</p> <p>  The model registry is in general a repository of a teams trained models where ML practitioners publish candidates for production and share them with others. Figure from wandb.  <ol> <li> <p>The model registry builds on the artifact registry in wandb. Any model that is uploaded to the model registry is     stored as an artifact. This means that we first need to log our trained models as artifacts before we can     register them in the model registry. Make sure you have logged at least one model as an artifact before     continuing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next lets create a registry. Go to the model registry tab (left pane, visible from your homepage) and then click     the <code>New Registered Model</code> button. Fill out the form and create the registry.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>When then need to link our artifact to the model registry we just created. We can do this in two ways: either     through the web interface or through the <code>wandb</code> API. In the web interface, go to the artifact you want to link     to the model registry and click the <code>Link to registry</code> button (upper right corner). If you want to use the     API you need to call the link method on a artifact object.</p> Solution <p>To use the API, create a new script called <code>link_to_registry.py</code> and add the following code:</p> link_to_registry.py<pre><code>import wandb\napi = wandb.Api()\nartifact_path = \"&lt;entity&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;artifact_name&gt;:&lt;version&gt;\"\nartifact = api.artifact(artifact_path)\nartifact.link(target_path=\"&lt;entity&gt;/model-registry/&lt;my_registry_name&gt;\")\nartifact.save()\n</code></pre> <p>In the code <code>&lt;entity&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;project&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;artifact_name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;my_registry_name&gt;</code> should be replaced with the appropriate values.</p> </li> <li> <p>We are now ready to consume our model, which can be done by downloading the artifact from the model registry. In     this case we use the wandb API to download the artifact.</p> <pre><code>import wandb\nrun = wandb.init()\nartifact = run.use_artifact('&lt;entity&gt;/model-registry/&lt;my_registry_name&gt;:&lt;version&gt;', type='model')\nartifact_dir = artifact.download(\"&lt;artifact_dir&gt;\")\nmodel = MyModel()\nmodel.load_state_dict(torch.load(\"&lt;artifact_dir&gt;/model.ckpt\"))\n</code></pre> <p>Try running this code with the appropriate values for <code>&lt;entity&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;my_registry_name&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;version&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;artifact_dir&gt;</code>. Make sure that you can load the model and that it is the same as the one you trained.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each model in the registry have at least one alias, which is the version of the model. The most recently added     model also receives the alias <code>latest</code>. Aliases are great for indicating where in workflow a model is, e.g. if     it is a candidate for production or if it is a model that is still being developed. Try adding an alias to one     of your models in the registry.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) A model always corresponds to an artifact, and artifacts can contain metadata that we can use to     automate the process of registering models. We could for example imaging that we at the end of each week run     a script that registers the best model from the week. Try creating a small script using the <code>wandb</code> API that     goes over a collection of artifacts and registers the best one.</p> Solution auto_register_best_model.py<pre><code>import logging\nimport operator\nimport os\n\nimport typer\nimport wandb\nfrom dotenv import load_dotenv\n\nlogger = logging.getLogger(__name__)\nload_dotenv()\n\n\ndef stage_best_model_to_registry(model_name: str, metric_name: str = \"accuracy\", higher_is_better: bool = True) -&gt; None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stage the best model to the model registry.\n\n    Args:\n        model_name: Name of the model to be registered.\n        metric_name: Name of the metric to choose the best model from.\n        higher_is_better: Whether higher metric values are better.\n\n    \"\"\"\n    api = wandb.Api(\n        api_key=os.getenv(\"WANDB_API_KEY\"),\n        overrides={\"entity\": os.getenv(\"WANDB_ENTITY\"), \"project\": os.getenv(\"WANDB_PROJECT\")},\n    )\n    artifact_collection = api.artifact_collection(type_name=\"model\", name=model_name)\n\n    best_metric = float(\"-inf\") if higher_is_better else float(\"inf\")\n    compare_op = operator.gt if higher_is_better else operator.lt\n    best_artifact = None\n    for artifact in list(artifact_collection.artifacts()):\n        if metric_name in artifact.metadata and compare_op(artifact.metadata[metric_name], best_metric):\n            best_metric = artifact.metadata[metric_name]\n            best_artifact = artifact\n\n    if best_artifact is None:\n        logging.error(\"No model found in registry.\")\n        return\n\n    logger.info(f\"Best model found in registry: {best_artifact.name} with {metric_name}={best_metric}\")\n    best_artifact.link(\n        target_path=f\"{os.getenv('WANDB_ENTITY')}/model-registry/{model_name}\",\n        aliases=[\"best\", \"staging\"],\n    )\n    best_artifact.save()\n    logger.info(\"Model staged to registry.\")\n\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    typer.run(stage_best_model_to_registry)\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <li> <p>In the future it will be important for us to be able to run Wandb inside a docker container (together with whatever     training or inference we specify). The problem here is that we cannot authenticate Wandb in the same way as the     previous exercise, it needs to happen automatically. Lets therefore look into how we can do that.</p> <ol> <li> <p>First we need to generate an authentication key, or more precise an API key. This is in general the way any     service (like a docker container) can authenticate. Start by going https://wandb.ai/home, click your profile     icon in the upper right corner and then go to settings. Scroll down to the danger zone and generate a new API     key and finally copy it.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next create a new docker file called <code>wandb.docker</code> and add the following code</p> <pre><code>FROM python:3.10-slim\nRUN apt update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential gcc &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\nRUN pip install wandb\nCOPY s4_debugging_and_logging/exercise_files/wandb_tester.py wandb_tester.py\nENTRYPOINT [\"python\", \"-u\", \"wandb_tester.py\"]\n</code></pre> <p>please take a look at the script being copied into the image and afterwards build the docker image.</p> </li> <li> <p>When we want to run the image, what we need to do is including a environment variables that contains the API key     we generated. This will then authenticate the docker container with the wandb server:</p> <pre><code>docker run -e WANDB_API_KEY=&lt;your-api-key&gt; wandb:latest\n</code></pre> <p>Try running it an confirm that the results are uploaded to the wandb server (1).</p> <ol> <li> If you have stored the API key in a <code>.env</code> file you can use the <code>--env-file</code> flag instead     of <code>-e</code> to load the environment variables from the file e.g. <code>docker run --env-file .env wandb:latest</code>.</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Feel free to experiment more with <code>wandb</code> as it is a great tool for logging, organizing and sharing experiments.</p> </li> <p>That is the module on logging. Please note that at this point in the course you will begin to see some overlap between the different frameworks. While we mainly used <code>hydra</code> for configuring our Python scripts it can also be used to save metrics and hyperparameters similar to how <code>wandb</code> can. Similar arguments holds for <code>dvc</code> which can also be used to log metrics. In our opinion <code>wandb</code> just offers a better experience when interacting with the results after logging. We want to stress that the combination of tools presented in this course may not be the best for all your future projects, and we recommend finding a setup that fits you. That said, each framework provide specific features that the others does not.</p> <p>Finally, we want to note that we during the course really try to showcase a lot of open source frameworks, Wandb is not one. It is free to use for personal usage (with a few restrictions) but for enterprise it does require a license. If you are eager to only work with open-source tools we highly recommend trying out MLFlow which offers the same overall functionalities as Wandb.</p>"},{"location":"s4_debugging_and_logging/profiling/","title":"M13 - Profiling","text":""},{"location":"s4_debugging_and_logging/profiling/#profilers","title":"Profilers","text":"<p>Core Module</p>"},{"location":"s4_debugging_and_logging/profiling/#profilers_1","title":"Profilers","text":"<p>In general profiling code is about improving the performance of your code.

When profiling this kind of machine learning code we are often looking for bottlenecks. A bottleneck is simple the place in your code that is preventing other processes from performing their best. This is the reason that all major deep learning frameworks also include their own profilers that can help profiling more complex applications.</p> <p>The image below show a typical report using the build in profiler in pytorch.

What is the bottleneck during the     training? Is it still the forward pass or is it something else? Can you improve the code somehow based on the     information from the profiler.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This end the module on profiling. If you want to go into more details on this topic we can recommend looking into line_profiler and kernprof. A downside of using python's <code>cProfile</code> is that it can only profiling at an functional/modular level, that is great for identifying hotspots in your code. However, sometimes the cause of an computationally hotspot is a single line of code in a function, which will not be caught by <code>cProfile</code>. An example would be an simple index operations such as <code>a[idx] = b</code>, which for large arrays and non-sequential indexes is really expensive. For these cases line_profiler and kernprof are excellent tools to have in your toolbox. Additionally, if you do not like cProfile we can also recommend py-spy which is another open-source profiling tool for Python programs.</p>"},{"location":"s5_continuous_integration/","title":"Continuous Integration","text":"<p>Slides</p> <ul> <li> <p>     Learn how to write unit tests that cover both data and models in your ML pipeline.</p> <p> M16: Unit testing</p> </li> <li> <p>     Learn how to implement continuous integration using GitHub actions such that tests are automatically executed on     code changes.</p> <p> M17: GitHub Actions</p> </li> <li> <p>     Learn how to use pre-commit to ensure that code that is not up to standard does not get committed.</p> <p> M18: Pre-commit</p> </li> <li> <p></p> <p>Learn how to implement continuous machine learning pipelines in GitHub actions.</p> <p> M19: Continuous Machine Learning</p> </li> </ul> <p>Continues integration is a sub-discipline of the general field of Continues X.

Create a new workflow file (call it <code>cml_data.yaml</code>) and make sure it only activates on push/pull-request events     when <code>data/</code> changes. Relevant     documentation</p> Solution <p>The secret is to use the <code>paths</code> keyword in the workflow file. We here specify that the workflow should only trigger when the <code>.dvc</code> folder or any file with the <code>.dvc</code> extension changes, which is the case when we update our data and call <code>dvc add data/</code>.</p> <pre><code>name: DVC Workflow\n\non:\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n    - main\n    paths:\n    - '**/*.dvc'\n    - '.dvc/**'\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The next step is to implement steps in our workflow that do something when data changes. This is the reason     why we created the <code>dataset_statistics</code> function. Implement a workflow that:</p> <ol> <li>Check-out the code</li> <li>Setups Python</li> <li>Installs dependencies</li> <li>Downloads the data</li> <li>Runs the <code>dataset_statistics</code> function on the data</li> </ol> Solution <p>This solution assumes that data is stored in a GCP bucket and that the credentials are stored in a secret called <code>GCP_SA_KEY</code>. If this is not the case for you, you need to adjust the workflow accordingly with the correct way to pull the data.</p> <pre><code>jobs:\n  run_data_checker:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      with:\n        python-version: 3.11\n        cache: 'pip'\n        cache-dependency-path: setup.py\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        make dev_requirements\n        pip list\n\n    - name: Auth with GCP\n      uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2\n      with:\n        credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCP_SA_KEY }}\n\n    - name: Pull data\n      run: |\n        dvc pull --no-run-cache\n\n    - name: Check data statistics\n      run: |\n        python dataset_statistics.py\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Let's make sure that the workflow works as expected for now. Create a new branch and either add or remove a file     in the <code>data/</code> folder. Then run</p> <pre><code>dvc add data/\ngit add data.dvc\ngit commit -m \"Update data\"\ngit push\n</code></pre> <p>to commit the changes to data. Open a pull request with the branch and make sure that the workflow activates and runs as expected.</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's now add the <code>cml</code> framework such that we can comment the results of the <code>dataset_statistics</code> function in     the pull request automatically. Look at the     getting started guide for help on how to do this. You will     need write all the content of the <code>dataset_statistics</code> function to a file called <code>report.md</code> and then use the     <code>cml comment create</code> command to create a comment in the pull request with the content of the file.</p> Solution <pre><code>jobs:\n  dataset_statistics:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    # ...all the previous steps\n    - name: Check data statistics &amp; generate report\n    run: |\n      python src/example_mlops/data.py &gt; data_statistics.md\n      echo '![](./mnist_images.png \"MNIST images\")' &gt;&gt; data_statistics.md\n      echo '![](./train_label_distribution.png \"Train label distribution\")' &gt;&gt; data_statistics.md\n      echo '![](./test_label_distribution.png \"Test label distribution\")' &gt;&gt; data_statistics.md\n\n    - name: Setup cml\n      uses: iterative/setup-cml@v2\n\n    - name: Comment on PR\n      env:\n        REPO_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}\n      run: |\n        cml comment create data_statistics.md --watermark-title=\"Data Checker\" # (1)!\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> The <code>--watermark-title</code> flag is used to watermark the comment created by <code>cml</code>. It is     to make sure that no new comments are created every time the workflow runs.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Make sure that the workflow works as expected. You should see a comment created by <code>github-actions (bot)</code> like     this if you have done everything correctly:</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Feel free to add more checks to the workflow. For example, you could add a check that runs a small     baseline model on the updated data and checks that the model converges. This is a very common sanity check that     is done in machine learning pipelines.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>For the second set of exercises, we are going to look at how to automatically run further testing of our models     whenever we add them to our model registry. For that reason, do not continue with this set of exercises before you     have completed the exercises on the model registry in this module.</p> <p>  The model registry is in general a repository of a team's trained models where ML practitioners publish candidates for production and share them with others. Figure from wandb.  <ol> <li> <p>The first step is in our weights and bias account to create a team. Some of these more advanced features are only     available for teams, however every user is allowed to create one team for free. Go to your weights and bias     account and create a team (the option should be on the left side of the UI). Give a team name and select W&amp;B     cloud storage.</p> </li> <li> <p>Now we need to generate a personal access token that can link our weights and bias account to our GitHub account.     Go to this page and generate a new token. You can also     find the page by clicking your profile icon in the upper right corner of GitHub and selecting     <code>Settings</code>, then <code>Developer settings</code>, then <code>Personal access tokens</code> and finally choose either     <code>Tokens (classic)</code> or <code>Fine-grained tokens</code> (which is the safer option, which is also what the link points to).</p> <p> </p> <p>give it a name, set what repositories it should have access to and select the permissions you want it to have. In our case if you choose to create <code>Fine-grained token</code> then it needs access to the <code>contents:write</code> permission. If you choose <code>Tokens (classic)</code> then it needs access to the <code>repo</code> permission. After you have created the token, copy it and save it somewhere safe.</p> </li> <li> <p>Go to the settings of your newly created team: https://wandb.ai/teamname/settings and scroll down to the     <code>Team secrets</code> section. Here add the token you just created as a secret with the name <code>GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN</code>.     WANDB will now be able to use this token to trigger actions in your repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>On the same settings page, scroll down to the <code>Webhooks</code> settings. Click the <code>New webhook</code> button in fill in the     following information:</p> <ul> <li>Name: <code>github_actions_dispatch</code></li> <li>URL: <code>https://api.github.com/repos/&lt;owner&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/dispatches</code></li> <li>Access token: <code>GITHUB_ACTIONS_TOKEN</code></li> <li>Secret: leave empty</li> </ul> <p>You here need to replace <code>&lt;owner&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;repo&gt;</code> with your own information. The <code>/dispatches</code> endpoint is a special endpoint that all GitHub actions workflows can listen to. Thus, if you ever want to setup a webhook in some other framework that should trigger a GitHub action, you can use this endpoint.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, navigate to your model registry. It should hopefully contain at least one registry with at least one model     registered. If not, go back to the previous module and do that.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you have a model in your registry, click on the <code>View details</code> button. Then click the <code>New automation</code>     button. On the first page, select that you want to trigger the automation when an alias is added to a model     version, set that alias to <code>staging</code> and select the action type to be <code>Webhook</code>. On the next page, select the     <code>github_actions_dispatch</code> webhook that you just created and add this as the payload:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"event_type\": \"staged_model\",\n    \"client_payload\":\n    {\n        \"event_author\": \"${event_author}\",\n        \"artifact_version\": \"${artifact_version}\",\n        \"artifact_version_string\": \"${artifact_version_string}\",\n        \"artifact_collection_name\": \"${artifact_collection_name}\",\n        \"project_name\": \"${project_name}\",\n        \"entity_name\": \"${entity_name}\"\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Finally, on the next page give the automation a name and click <code>Create automation</code>.</p> <p> </p> <p>Make sure you understand overall what is happening here.</p> Solution <p>The automation is set up to trigger a webhook whenever the alias <code>staging</code> is added to a model version. The webhook is set up to trigger a GitHub action workflow that listens to the <code>/dispatches</code> endpoint and has the event type <code>staged_model</code>. The payload that is sent to the webhook contains information about the model that was staged.</p> </li> <li> <p>We are now ready to create the <code>GitHub actions workflow</code> that listens to the <code>/dispatches</code> endpoint and triggers     whenever a model is staged. Create a new workflow file (called <code>stage_model.yaml</code>) and make sure it only     activates on the <code>staged_model</code> event. Hint: relevant     documentation</p> Solution <pre><code>name: Check staged model\n\non:\n  repository_dispatch:\n    types: staged_model\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Next, we need to implement the steps in our workflow that do something when a model is staged. The payload that     is sent to the webhook contains information about the model that was staged. Implement a workflow that:</p> <ol> <li>Identifies the model that was staged</li> <li>Sets an environment variable with the corresponding artifact path</li> <li>Outputs the model name</li> </ol> Solution <pre><code>jobs:\n  identify_event:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    outputs:\n      model_name: ${{ steps.set_output.outputs.model_name }}\n    steps:\n      - name: Check event type\n        run: |\n          echo \"Event type: repository_dispatch\"\n          echo \"Payload Data: ${{ toJson(github.event.client_payload) }}\"\n\n      - name: Setting model environment variable and output\n        id: set_output\n        run: |\n          echo \"model_name=${{ github.event.client_payload.artifact_version_string }}\" &gt;&gt; $GITHUB_OUTPUT\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>We now need to write a script that can be executed on our staged model. In this case, we are going to run some     performance tests on it to check that it is fast enough for deployment. Therefore, do the following:</p> <ol> <li> <p>In a <code>tests/performancetests</code> folder, create a new file called <code>test_model.py</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Implement a test that loads the model from an wandb artifact path e.g.     //: and runs it on a random input. Importantly, the     artifact path should be read from an environment variable called <code>MODEL_NAME</code>. <li> <p>The test should assert that the model can do 100 predictions in less than X amount of time</p> </li> Solution <p>In this solution we assume that 4 environment variables are set: <code>WANDB_API</code>, <code>WANDB_ENTITY</code>, <code>WANDB_PROJECT</code> and <code>MODEL_NAME</code>.</p> test_model.py<pre><code>import wandb\nimport os\nimport time\nfrom my_project.models import MyModel\n\ndef load_model(artifact):\n    api = wandb.Api(\n        api_key=os.getenv(\"WANDB_API_KEY\"),\n        overrides={\"entity\": os.getenv(\"WANDB_ENTITY\"), \"project\": os.getenv(\"WANDB_PROJECT\")},\n    )\n    artifact = api.artifact(model_checkpoint)\n    artifact.download(root=logdir)\n    file_name = artifact.files()[0].name\n    return MyModel.load_from_checkpoint(f\"{logdir}/{file_name}\")\n\ndef test_model_speed():\n    model = load_model(os.getenv(\"MODEL_NAME\"))\n    start = time.time()\n    for _ in range(100):\n        model(torch.rand(1, 1, 28, 28))\n    end = time.time()\n    assert end - start &lt; 1\n</code></pre> <li> <p>Let's now add another job that calls the script we just wrote. It needs to:</p> <ul> <li>Setup the correct environment variables</li> <li>Checkout the code</li> <li>Setup Python</li> <li>Install dependencies</li> <li>Run the test</li> </ul> <p>which is very similar to the kind of jobs we have written before.</p> Solution <pre><code>jobs:\n  identify_event:\n    ...\n  test_model:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    needs: identify_event\n    env:\n      WANDB_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.WANDB_API_KEY }}\n      WANDB_ENTITY: ${{ secrets.WANDB_ENTITY }}\n      WANDB_PROJECT: ${{ secrets.WANDB_PROJECT }}\n      MODEL_NAME: ${{ needs.identify_event.outputs.model_name }}\n    steps:\n    - name: Echo model name\n      run: |\n        echo \"Model name: $MODEL_NAME\"\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      with:\n        python-version: 3.11\n        cache: 'pip'\n        cache-dependency-path: setup.py\n\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n        pip list\n\n    - name: Test model\n      run: |\n        pytest tests/performancetests/test_model.py\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we are going to assume in this setup that if the model gets this far then it is ready for deployment.     We are therefore going to add a final job that will add a new alias to the model called <code>production</code>. Here is     some relevant Python code that can be used to add the alias:</p> <pre><code>import typer\nimport os\nimport wandb\n\n\ndef link_model(artifact_path: str, aliases: list[str] = [\"staging\"]) -&gt; None:\n    \"\"\"\n    Stage a specific model to the model registry.\n\n    Args:\n        artifact_path: Path to the artifact to stage.\n            Should be of the format \"entity/project/artifact_name:version\".\n        aliases: List of aliases to link the artifact with.\n\n    Example:\n        model_management link-model entity/project/artifact_name:version -a staging -a best\n\n    \"\"\"\n    if artifact_path == \"\":\n        typer.echo(\"No artifact path provided.

To try it out again and again for testing purposes, you can     just manually add and then delete the <code>staging</code> alias to any model version in the model registry.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Consider adding more checks to the workflow. For example, you could add a step that checks if the     model is too large for deployment, runs some further evaluation scripts, or checks if the model is robust to     adversarial attacks. Only the imagination sets the limits here.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) If you have got this far, consider combining principles from the two exercises. Here is an idea: we use     the workflow from the second exercise to trigger a workflow that checks a staged model for performance. We then     use the <code>cml</code> framework to automatically create a pull request e.g. use <code>cml pr create</code> instead of     <code>cml comment create</code> to create a pull request with the results of the performance test. Then if we are happy with     the performance, we can then approve that pull request and the production alias is added to the model. This is a     better workflow because it allows for human intervention before the model is deployed.</p> </li>"},{"location":"s5_continuous_integration/cml/#knowledge-check","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Knowledge check","text":"<ol> <li> <p>What is the difference between continuous integration and continuous machine learning?</p> Solution <p>There are three key differences between continuous integration and continuous machine learning:</p> <ul> <li>Scope: CI focuses on integrating and testing software code, while CML encompasses the entire lifecycle of     machine learning models, including data handling, model training, evaluation, deployment, and monitoring.</li> <li>Automation Focus: CI automates code testing and integration, whereas CML automates the training, evaluation,     deployment, and monitoring of machine learning models.</li> <li>Feedback Mechanisms: CI primarily uses automated tests to provide feedback on code quality.

You do not have     to understand everything, but at least get a feeling of what a workflow file should look like.</p> </li> <li> <p>We have provided a workflow file called <code>tests.yaml</code> that should run your tests for you. Place     this file in the <code>.github/workflows/</code> folder. The workflow file consists of three steps</p> <ul> <li> <p>First, a Python environment is initiated (in this case Python 3.8)</p> </li> <li> <p>Next all dependencies required to run the test are installed</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, <code>pytest</code> is called and our tests will be run</p> </li> </ul> <p>Go over the file and try to understand the overall structure and syntax of the file.</p> <code>tests.yaml</code> tests.yaml<pre><code>name: \"Run tests\"\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ master, main ]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [ master, main ]\n\njobs:\n  build:\n\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout\n      uses: actions/checkout@v4\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      with:\n        python-version: 3.11\n    - name: Install dependencies\n      run: |\n        python -m pip install --upgrade pip\n        pip install -r requirements.txt\n        pip install -r requirements_tests.txt\n    - name: Test with pytest\n      run: |\n        pytest -v\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>For the script to work you need to define the <code>requirements.txt</code> and <code>requirements_tests.txt</code>.

However, continuous integration enables us to automatically test on other systems than the one we are using.</p> <ol> <li> <p>The provided <code>tests.yaml</code> only runs on one operating system. Which one?</p> </li> <li> <p>Alter the file such that it executes the test on the two other main operating systems that exist. You can find     information on available operating systems also called runners here</p> Solution <p>We can \"parametrize\" of script to run on different operating systems by using the <code>strategy</code> attribute. This attribute allows us to define a matrix of values that the workflow will run on. The following code will run the tests on <code>ubuntu-latest</code>, <code>windows-latest</code>, and <code>macos-latest</code>:</p> tests.yaml<pre><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [\"ubuntu-latest\", \"windows-latest\", \"macos-latest\"]\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Can you also figure out how to run the tests using different Python versions?</p> Solution <p>Just add another line to the <code>strategy</code> attribute that specifies the Python version and use the value in the setup Python action. The following code will run the tests on Python versions</p> tests.yaml<pre><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      matrix:\n        os: [\"ubuntu-latest\", \"windows-latest\", \"macos-latest\"]\n        python-version: [\"3.10\", \"3.11\", \"3.12\"]\n\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n    - name: Set up Python\n      uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n      with:\n        python-version: ${{ matrix.python-version }}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>If you push the changes above you will maybe see that whenever one of the tests in the matrix fails, it will     automatically cancel the other tests. This is for saving time and resources. However, sometimes you want all the     tests to run even if one fails. Can you figure out how to do that?</p> Solution <p>You can set the <code>fail-fast</code> attribute to <code>false</code> under the <code>strategy</code> attribute:</p> tests.yaml<pre><code>jobs:\n  build:\n    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}\n    strategy:\n      fail-fast: false\n      matrix:\n        os: [\"ubuntu-latest\", \"windows-latest\", \"macos-latest\"]\n        python-version: [\"3.10\", \"3.11\", \"3.12\"]\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>As the workflow is currently implemented, GitHub actions will destroy every downloaded package     when the workflow has been executed. To improve this we can take advantage of <code>caching</code>:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Figure out how to implement <code>caching</code> in your workflow file. You can find a guide     here and     here.</p> Solution tests.yaml<pre><code>steps:\n- uses: actions/checkout@v4\n- uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n  with:\n    python-version: 3.11\n    cache: 'pip' # caching pip dependencies\n- run: pip install -r requirements.txt\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>When you have implemented a caching system go to <code>Actions-&gt;Caches</code> in your repository and make sure that they     are correctly added. It should look something like the image below</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Measure how long your workflow takes before and after adding <code>caching</code> to your workflow. Did it improve the     runtime of your workflow?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Code coverage can also be added to the workflow file by uploading it as an artifact     after running the coverage. Follow the instructions in this     post     on how to do it.</p> </li> <li> <p>With different checks in place, it is a good time to learn about branch protection rules. A branch     protection rule is essentially some kind of guarding that prevents you from merging code into a branch before     certain conditions are met. In this exercise, we will create a branch protection rule that requires all checks to     pass before merging code into the main branch.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by going into your <code>Settings -&gt; Rules -&gt; Rulesets</code> and create a new branch ruleset. See the image below.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>In the ruleset start by giving it a name and then set the target branches to be <code>Default branch</code>. This means that     the ruleset will be applied to your master/main branch. As shown in the image below, two rules may be     particularly beneficial when you later start working with other people:</p> <ul> <li> <p>The first rule to consider is Require a pull request before merging. As the name suggests this rule     requires that changes that are to be merged into the main branch must be done through a pull request. This     is a good practice as it allows for code review and testing before the code is merged into the main branch.     Additionally, this opens the option to specify that the code must be reviewed (or at least approved) by     a certain number of people.</p> </li> <li> <p>The second rule to consider is Require status checks to pass. This rule makes sure that our workflows     are passing before we can merge code into the main branch. You can select which workflows are required, as     some may be nice to have passing but not strictly needed.</p> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Finally, if you think the rules are a bit too restrictive you can always add that the repository admin e.g. you can bypass the rules by adding <code>Repository admin</code> to the bypass list. Implement the following rules:</p> <ul> <li>At least one person needs to approve any PR</li> <li>All your workflows need to pass</li> <li>All conversations need to be resolved</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If you have created the rules correctly you should see something like the image below when you try to merge a     pull request. In this case, all three checks are required to pass before the code can be merged. Additionally,     a single reviewer is required to approve the code. A bypass rule is also setup for the repository admin.</p> <p> </p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>One problem you may have encountered is running your tests that have to do with your data, with the core problem     being that your data is not stored in GitHub (assuming you have done module     M8 - DVC) and therefore cannot be tested. However, we can download     data while running our continuous integration. Let's try to create that:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The first problem is that we need our continuous integration pipeline to be able to authenticate with our storage     solution. We can take advantage of an authentication file that is created the first time we push with DVC. It is     located in <code>$CACHE_HOME/pydrive2fs/{gdrive_client_id}/default.json</code> where <code>$CACHE_HOME</code> depends on your     operating system:</p> macOSLinuxWindows <p><code>~/Library/Caches</code></p> <p><code>~/.cache</code>  This is the typical location, but it may vary depending on what distro you are running</p> <p><code>{user}/AppData/Local</code></p> <p>Find the file. The content should look similar to this (only some fields are shown):</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"access_token\": ...,\n    \"client_id\": ...,\n    \"client_secret\": ...,\n    \"refresh_token\": ...,\n    ...\n}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The content of that file should be treated as a password and not shared with the world and the relevant     question is therefore how to use this info in a public repository. The answer is GitHub secrets, where we     can store information, and access it in our workflow files and it is still not public. Navigate to the secrets     option (as shown below) and create a secret with the name <code>GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_DATA</code> that contains the content     of the file you found in the previous exercise.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Afterward, add the following code to your workflow file:</p> <pre><code>- uses: iterative/setup-dvc@v1\n- name: Get data\n  run: dvc pull\n  env:\n    GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_DATA: ${{ secrets.GDRIVE_CREDENTIALS_DATA }}\n</code></pre> <p>that runs <code>dvc pull</code> using the secret authentication file. For help you can visit this small repository that implements the same workflow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, add the changes, commit, push and confirm that everything works as expected. You should now be able to     run unit tests that depend on your input data.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>In module M6 on good coding practices     (optional module) of the course you were introduced to a couple of good coding practices such as being consistent     with your coding style, how your Python packages are sorted and that your code follows certain standards. All this     was done using the <code>ruff</code> framework. In this set of exercises, we will create GitHub workflows that will     automatically test for this.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Create a new workflow file called <code>codecheck.yaml</code>, that implements the following three steps</p> <ul> <li> <p>Setup Python environment</p> </li> <li> <p>Installs <code>ruff</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Runs <code>ruff check</code> and <code>ruff format</code> on the repository</p> </li> </ul> <p>(HINT: You should be able to just change the last steps of the <code>tests.yaml</code> workflow file)</p> Solution codecheck.yaml<pre><code>name: Code formatting\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches:\n    - main\n  pull_request:\n    branches:\n    - main\n\njobs:\n  format:\n      runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n      steps:\n      - name: Checkout code\n        uses: actions/checkout@v4\n      - name: Set up Python\n        uses: actions/setup-python@v5\n        with:\n          python-version: 3.11\n          cache: 'pip'\n          cache-dependency-path: setup.py\n      - name: Install dependencies\n        run: |\n          pip install ruff\n          pip list\n      - name: Ruff check\n        run: ruff check .\n      - name: Ruff format\n        run: ruff format .\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>In addition to <code>ruff</code> we also used <code>mypy</code> in those sets of exercises for checking if the typing we added to our     code was good enough. Add another step to the <code>codecheck.yaml</code> file which runs <code>mypy</code> on your repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to make sure that all steps are passed on repository. Especially <code>mypy</code> can be hard to get a passing, so this     exercise formally only requires you to get <code>ruff</code> passing.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) As you have probably already experienced in module M9 on docker it can     be cumbersome to build docker images, sometimes taking a couple of minutes to build each time we make changes to our     code base. For this reason, we just want to build a new image every time we commit our code because that should mark     that we believe the code to be working at that point. Thus, let's automate the process of building our docker images     using GitHub actions. Do note that in a future module will look at how to     build containers using cloud providers, and this exercise is therefore very much optional.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by making sure you have a dockerfile in your repository. If you do not have one, you can use the following     simple dockerfile:</p> <pre><code>FROM busybox\nCMD echo \"Howdy cowboy\"\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Push the dockerfile to your repository</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, create a Docker Hub account</p> </li> <li> <p>Within Docker Hub create an access token by going to <code>Settings -&gt; Security</code>. Click the <code>New Access Token</code> button     and give it a name that you recognize.</p> </li> <li> <p>Copy the newly created access token and head over to your GitHub repository online. Go to     <code>Settings -&gt; Secrets -&gt; Actions</code> and click the <code>New repository secret</code>. Copy over the access token and give     it the name <code>DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN</code>. Additionally, add two other secrets <code>DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME</code> and     <code>DOCKER_HUB_REPOSITORY</code> that contain your docker username and docker repository name respectively.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, we are going to construct the actual GitHub actions workflow file</p> <pre><code>name: Docker Image continuous integration\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [ master ]\n\njobs:\n    build:\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - uses: actions/checkout@v4\n    - name: Build the Docker image\n      run: |\n        echo \"${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_TOKEN }}\" | docker login \\\n          -u \"${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}\" --password-stdin docker.io\n        docker build . --file Dockerfile \\\n          --tag docker.io/${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_REPOSITORY }}:$GITHUB_SHA\n        docker push \\\n          docker.io/${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_USERNAME }}/${{ secrets.DOCKER_HUB_REPOSITORY }}:$GITHUB_SHA\n</code></pre> <p>The first part of the workflow file should look somewhat recognizable. However, the last three lines are where all the magic happens. Carefully go through them and figure out what they do. If you want some help you can look at the help page for <code>docker login</code>, <code>docker build</code> and <code>docker push</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Upload the workflow to your GitHub repository and check that it is being executed. If everything works you should     be able to see the build docker image in your container repository in the docker hub.</p> </li> <li> <p>Make sure that you can execute <code>docker pull</code> locally to pull down the image that you just continuously build</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) To test that the container works directly in GitHub you can also try to include an additional     step that runs the container.</p> <pre><code>    - name: Run container\n      run: |\n        docker run ...\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"s5_continuous_integration/github_actions/#dependabot","title":"Dependabot","text":"<p>A great feature that GitHub provides is the ability to have bots help you with maintaining your repository.

Continuous integration should ensure that whenever a codebase is updated it is automatically tested such that if bugs have been introduced in the codebase it will be caught early on. If you look at the MLOps cycle, continuous integration is one of the cornerstones of the operations part. However, it should be noted that applying continuous integration does not magically secure that your code does not break. Continuous integration is only as strong as the tests that are automatically executed. Continuous integration simply structures and automates this.</p> <p>Quote</p> <p>Continuous Integration doesn\u2019t get rid of bugs, but it does make them dramatically easier to find and remove.  Martin Fowler, Chief Scientist, ThoughtWorks</p> <p></p>  Image credit  <p>The kind of tests we are going to look at are called unit testing. Unit testing refers to the practice of writing test that tests individual parts of your code base to test for correctness. By unit, you can therefore think of a function, module or in general any object. By writing tests in this way it should be very easy to isolate which part of the code broke after an update to the code base. Another way to test your code base would be through integration testing which is equally important but we are not going to focus on it in this course.</p> <p>Unit tests (and integration tests) are not a unique concept to MLOps but are a core concept of DevOps. However, it is important to note that testing machine learning-based systems is much more difficult than traditional systems. The reason for this is that machine learning systems depend on data, that influences the state of our system. For this reason, we not only need unit tests and integration tests of our code we also need data testing, infrastructure testing and more monitoring to check that we stay within the data distribution we are training on (more on this in module M25 on data drifting). This added complexity is illustrated in the figure below.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"s5_continuous_integration/unittesting/#pytest","title":"Pytest","text":"<p>Before we can begin to automate testing of our code base we of course need to write the tests first. It is both a hard and tedious task to do but arguably the most important aspect of continuous integration. Python offers a couple of different libraries for writing tests. We are going to use <code>pytest</code>.</p>"},{"location":"s5_continuous_integration/unittesting/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>The following exercises should be applied to your MNIST repository</p> <ol> <li> <p>The first part of doing continuous integration is writing the unit tests. We do not expect you to cover every part     of the code you have developed but try to at least write tests that cover two files. Start by     creating a <code>tests</code> folder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Read the getting started guide for pytest     which is the testing framework that we are going to use</p> </li> <li> <p>Install pytest:</p> <pre><code>pip install pytest\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Write some tests. Below are some guidelines on some tests that should be implemented, but     you are of course free to implement more tests. You can at any point check if your tests are     passing by typing in a terminal</p> <pre><code>pytest tests/\n</code></pre> <p>When you implement a test you need to follow two standards, for <code>pytest</code> to be able to find your tests. First, any files created (except <code>__init__.py</code>) should always start with <code>test_*.py</code>. Secondly, any test implemented needs to be wrapped into a function that again needs to start with <code>test_*</code>:</p> <pre><code># this will be found and executed by pytest\ndef test_something():\n    ...\n\n# this will not be found and executed by pytest\ndef something_to_test():\n    ...\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Start by creating a <code>tests/__init__.py</code> file and fill in the following:</p> <pre><code>import os\n_TEST_ROOT = os.path.dirname(__file__)  # root of test folder\n_PROJECT_ROOT = os.path.dirname(_TEST_ROOT)  # root of project\n_PATH_DATA = os.path.join(_PROJECT_ROOT, \"data\")  # root of data\n</code></pre> <p>these can help you refer to your data files during testing. For example, in another test file, I could write</p> <pre><code>from tests import _PATH_DATA\n</code></pre> <p>which then contains the root path to my data.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data testing: In a file called <code>tests/test_data.py</code> implement at least a test that checks that data gets     correctly loaded. By this, we mean that you should check</p> <pre><code>def test_data():\n    dataset = MNIST(...)\n    assert len(dataset) == N_train for training and N_test for test\n    assert that each datapoint has shape [1,28,28] or [784] depending on how you choose to format\n    assert that all labels are represented\n</code></pre> <p>where <code>N_train</code> should be either 30.000 or 50.000 depending on if you are just the first subset of the corrupted MNIST data or also including the second subset. <code>N_test</code> should be 5000.</p> Solution <pre><code>from my_project.data import corrupt_mnist\n\ndef test_data():\n    train, test = corrupt_mnist()\n    assert len(train) == 30000\n    assert len(test) == 5000\n    for dataset in [train, test]:\n        for x, y in dataset:\n            assert x.shape == (1, 28, 28)\n            assert y in range(10)\n    train_targets = torch.unique(train.tensors[1])\n    assert (train_targets == torch.arange(0,10)).all()\n    test_targets = torch.unique(test.tensors[1])\n    assert (test_targets == torch.arange(0,10)).all()\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Model testing: In a file called <code>tests/test_model.py</code> implement at least a test that checks for a given input     with shape X that the output of the model has shape Y.</p> Solution <pre><code>from my_project.model import MyAwesomeModel\n\ndef test_model():\n    model = MyAwesomeModel()\n    x = torch.randn(1, 1, 28, 28)\n    y = model(x)\n    assert y.shape == (1, 10)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Training testing: In a file called <code>tests/test_training.py</code> implement at least one test that asserts something     about your training script. You are here given free hands on what should be tested but try to test something     that risks being broken when developing the code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Good code raises errors and gives out warnings in appropriate places. This is often in     the case of some invalid combination of input to your script. For example, your model could check for the size     of the input given to it (see code below) to make sure it corresponds to what you are expecting. Not     implementing such errors would still result in PyTorch failing at a later point due to shape errors, however,     these custom errors will probably make more sense to the end user. Implement at least one raised error or     warning somewhere in your code and use either <code>pytest.raises</code> or <code>pytest.warns</code> to check that     they are correctly raised/warned. As inspiration, the following implements <code>ValueError</code> in code     belonging to the model:</p> <pre><code># src/models/model.py\ndef forward(self, x: Tensor):\n    if x.ndim != 4:\n        raise ValueError('Expected input to a 4D tensor')\n    if x.shape[1] != 1 or x.shape[2] != 28 or x.shape[3] != 28:\n        raise ValueError('Expected each sample to have shape [1, 28, 28]')\n</code></pre> Solution <p>The above example would be captured by a test looking something like this:</p> <pre><code># tests/test_model.py\nimport pytest\nfrom my_project.model import MyAwesomeModel\n\ndef test_error_on_wrong_shape():\n    model = MyAwesomeModel()\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match='Expected input to a 4D tensor')\n        model(torch.randn(1,2,3))\n    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match='Expected each sample to have shape [1, 28, 28]')\n        model(torch.randn(1,1,28,29))\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>A test is only as good as the error message it gives, and by default, <code>assert</code> will only report that the     check failed. However, we can help ourselves and others by adding strings after <code>assert</code> like</p> <pre><code>assert len(train_dataset) == N_train, \"Dataset did not have the correct number of samples\"\n</code></pre> <p>Add such comments to the assert statements you just did in the previous exercises.</p> </li> <li> <p>The tests that involve checking anything that has to do with our data, will of course fail     if the data is not present. To future-proof our code, we can take advantage of the     <code>pytest.mark.skipif</code> decorator. Use this decorator to skip your data tests if the corresponding     data files do not exist. It should look something like this</p> <pre><code>import os.path\n@pytest.mark.skipif(not os.path.exists(file_path), reason=\"Data files not found\")\ndef test_something_about_data():\n    ...\n</code></pre> <p>You can read more about skipping tests here</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>After writing the different tests, make sure that they are passing locally.</p> </li> <li> <p>We often want to check a function/module for various input arguments. In this case, you could write the same test     over and over again for different inputs, but <code>pytest</code> also has built-in support for this with the use of the     pytest.mark.parametrize decorator. Implement a parametrized     test and make sure that it runs for different inputs.</p> Solution <pre><code>@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"batch_size\", [32, 64])\ndef test_model(batch_size: int) -&gt; None:\n    model = MyModel()\n    x = torch.randn(batch_size, 1, 28, 28)\n    y = model(x)\n    assert y.shape == (batch_size, 10)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>There is no way of measuring how good the test you have written is. However, what we can measure is the     code coverage. Code coverage refers to the percentage of your codebase that gets run when all your     tests are executed. Having a high coverage at least means that all your code will run when executed.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Install coverage</p> <pre><code>pip install coverage\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Instead of running your tests directly with <code>pytest</code>, now do</p> <pre><code>coverage run -m pytest tests/\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>To get a simple coverage report simply type</p> <pre><code>coverage report\n</code></pre> <p>which will give you the percentage of cover in each of your files. You can also write</p> <pre><code>coverage report -m\n</code></pre> <p>to get the exact lines that were missed by your tests.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, try to increase the coverage by writing a new test that runs some     of the lines in your codebase that are not covered yet.</p> </li> <li> <p>Often <code>coverage</code> reports the code coverage on files that we do not want to get a code coverage for, for example     your test file. Figure out how to configure <code>coverage</code> to exclude some files.</p> Solution <p>You need to set the <code>omit</code> option. This can either be done when running <code>coverage run</code> or <code>coverage report</code> such as:</p> <pre><code>coverage run --omit=\"tests/*\" -m pytest tests/\n# or\ncoverage report --omit=\"tests/*\"\n</code></pre> <p>As an alternative you can specify this in your <code>pyproject.toml</code> file:</p> <pre><code>[tool.coverage.run]\nomit = [\"tests/*\"]\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"s5_continuous_integration/unittesting/#knowledge-check","title":"\ud83e\udde0 Knowledge check","text":"<ol> <li> <p>Assuming you have a code coverage of 100%, would you expect that no bugs are present in your code?</p> Solution <p>No, code coverage is not a guarantee that your code is bug-free. It is just a measure of how many lines of code are run when your tests are executed. Therefore, there may still be some corner case that is not covered by your tests and will result in a bug. However, having a high code coverage is a good indicator that you have tested your code.</p> </li> <li> <p>Consider the following code:</p> <pre><code>@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"network_size\", [10, 100, 1000])\n@pytest.mark.parametrize(\"device\", [\"cpu\", \"cuda\"])\nclass MyTestClass:\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"network_type\", [\"alexnet\", \"squeezenet\", \"vgg\", \"resnet\"])\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"precision\", [torch.half, torch.float, torch.double])\n    def test_network1(self, network_size, device, network_type, precision):\n        if device == \"cuda\" and not torch.cuda.is_available():\n            pytest.skip(\"Test requires cuda\")\n        model = MyModelClass(network_size, network_type).to(device=device, dtype=precision)\n        ...\n\n    @pytest.mark.parametrize(\"add_dropout\", [True, False])\n    def test_network2(self, network_size, device, add_dropout):\n        if device == \"cuda\" and not torch.cuda.is_available():\n            pytest.skip(\"Test requires cuda\")\n        model = MyModelClass2(network_size, add_dropout).to(device)\n        ...\n</code></pre> <p>how many tests are executed when running the above code?</p> Solution <p>The answer depends on whether or not we are running on a GPU-enabled machine. The <code>test_network1</code> has 4 parameters, <code>network_size, device, network_type, precision</code>, that respectively can take on <code>3, 2, 4, 3</code> values meaning that in total that test will be running <code>3x2x4x3=72</code> times with different parameters on a GPU-enabled machine and 36 on a machine without a GPU. A similar calculation can be done for <code>test_network2</code>, which only has three factors <code>network_size, device, add_dropout</code> that result in <code>3x2x2=12</code> test on a GPU-enabled machine and 6 on a machine without a GPU. In total, that means 84 tests would run on a machine with a GPU and 42 on a machine without a GPU.</p> </li> </ol> <p>That covers the basics of writing unit tests for Python code. We want to note that <code>pytest</code> of course is not the only framework for doing this. Python has a built-in framework called unittest for doing this also (but <code>pytest</code> offers a bit more features). Another open-source framework that you could choose to check out is hypothesis which can help catch errors in corner cases of your code. In addition to writing unit tests it is also highly recommended to test code that you include in your docstring belonging to your functions and modulus to make sure that any code there is in your documentation is also correct. For such testing, we can highly recommend using Python built-in framework doctest.</p>"},{"location":"s6_the_cloud/","title":"Cloud computing","text":"<p>Slides</p> <ul> <li> <p></p> <p>Learn how to get started with Google Cloud Platform and how to interact with the SDK.</p> <p> M20: Cloud Setup</p> </li> <li> <p></p> <p>Learn how to use different GCP services to support your machine learning pipeline.</p> <p> M21: Cloud Services</p> </li> </ul> <p>Running computations locally is often sufficient when only playing around with code in the initial phase of development.

Admin here in general refers to the different roles that users of GCP and quotas refer to the amount of resources that a given user has access to. For example, one employee, let's say a data scientist, may only be granted access to certain GCP services that have to do with the development and training of machine learning models, with <code>X</code> amounts of GPUs available to use to make sure that the employee does not spend too much money. Another employee, a DevOps engineer, probably does not need access to the same services and not necessarily the same resources.</p> <p>In this course, we are not going to focus too much on this aspect but it is important to know that it exists. One feature you are going to need for doing the project is how to share a project with other people. This is done through the IAM (Identities and Access Management) page. Simply click the <code>Grant Access</code> button, search for the email of the person you want to share the project with and give them either <code>Viewer</code>, <code>Editor</code> or <code>Owner</code> access, depending on what you want them to be able to do. The figure below shows how to do this.</p> <p></p> <p>What we are going to go through right now is how to increase the quotas for how many GPUs you have available for your project.

You can hopefully recognize the syntax from the docker exercises. In this example, we are calling the <code>cloud-builders/docker</code> service with both the <code>build</code> and <code>push</code> arguments.</p> </li> <li> <p>You can now try to trigger the <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> file from your local machine. What <code>gcloud</code> command would you use     to do this?</p> Solution <p>You can trigger a build by running the following command:</p> <pre><code>gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml .\n</code></pre> <p>This command will submit a build to the cloud build service using the configuration file <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> in the current directory.</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead of relying on manually submitting builds, we can setup the building process as continuous integration such     that it is triggered every time we push code to the repository. This is done by setting up a     trigger in the GCP console. From the GCP homepage, navigate to the     triggers panel:</p> <p> </p> <p>Click on the manage repositories.</p> <ol> <li> <p>From there, click the <code>Connect Repository</code> and go through the steps of authenticating your GitHub profile with     GCP and choose the repository that you want to setup build triggers. For now, skip the     <code>Create a trigger (optional)</code> part by pressing <code>Done</code> in the end.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>Navigate back to the <code>Triggers</code> homepage and click <code>Create trigger</code>. Set the following:</p> <ul> <li>Give a name</li> <li>Event: choose <code>Push to branch</code></li> <li>Source: choose the repository you just connected</li> <li>Branch: choose <code>^main$</code></li> <li>Configuration: choose either <code>Autodetected</code> or <code>Cloud build configuration file</code></li> </ul> <p>Finally, click the <code>Create</code> button and the trigger should show up on the triggers page.</p> </li> <li> <p>To activate the trigger, push some code to the chosen repository.</p> </li> <li> <p>Go to the <code>Cloud Build</code> page and you should see the image being built and pushed.</p> <p> </p> <p>Try clicking on the build to check out the build process and build summary. As you can see from the image, if a build is failing you will often find valuable info by looking at the build summary. If your build is failing try to configure it to run in one of these regions: <code>us-central1, us-west2, europe-west1, asia-east1, australia-southeast1, southamerica-east1</code> as specified in the documentation.</p> </li> <li> <p>If/when your build is successful, navigate to the <code>Artifact Registry</code> page. You should hopefully find that the     image you just built was pushed here. Congrats!</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Make sure that you can pull your image down to your laptop</p> <pre><code>docker pull &lt;region&gt;-docker.pkg.dev/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;registry-name&gt;/&lt;image-name&gt;:&lt;image-tag&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>you will need to authenticate <code>docker</code> with GCP first. Instructions can be found here, but the following command should hopefully be enough to make <code>docker</code> and GCP talk to each other:</p> <pre><code>gcloud auth configure-docker &lt;region&gt;-docker.pkg.dev\n</code></pre> <p>where you need to replace <code>&lt;region&gt;</code> with the region you are using. Do note you need to have <code>docker</code> actively running in the background, as any other time you want to use <code>docker</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Automatization through the cloud is in general the way to go, but sometimes you may want to manually create images     and push them to the registry. Figure out how to push an image to your <code>Artifact Registry</code>. For simplicity, you can     just push the <code>busybox</code> image you downloaded during the initial docker exercises. This     page should help you with exercise.</p> Solution <p>Pushing to a repository is similar to pulling. Assuming that you have already built an image called <code>busybox</code> you can push it to the repository by running:</p> <pre><code>docker tag busybox &lt;region&gt;-docker.pkg.dev/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;registry-name&gt;/busybox:latest\ndocker push &lt;region&gt;-docker.pkg.dev/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;registry-name&gt;/busybox:latest\n</code></pre> <p>where you need to replace <code>&lt;region&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;project-id&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;registry-name&gt;</code> with your own values.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Instead of using the built-in trigger in GCP, another way to activate the build-on code changes is to     integrate with GitHub Actions. This has the benefit that we can make the build process depend on other steps in the     pipeline. For example, in the image below we have conditioned the build to only run if tests are passing on     all operating systems. Lets try to implement this.</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by adding a new secret to GitHub with the name <code>GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY</code> and the value of the service account     key that you created in the previous module. This is needed to authenticate the GitHub action with GCP.</p> </li> <li> <p>We assume that you already have a workflow file that runs some unit tests:</p> <pre><code>name: Unit tests &amp; build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n</code></pre> <p>we now want to add a job that triggers the build process in GCP. How can you make the <code>build</code> job depend on the <code>test</code> job? Hint: Relevant documentation.</p> Solution <p>You can make the <code>build</code> job depend on the <code>test</code> job by adding the <code>needs</code> keyword to the <code>build</code> job:</p> <pre><code>name: Unit tests &amp; build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    ...\n  build:\n    needs: test\n    ...\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Additionally, we probably only want to build the image if the job is running on our main branch e.g. not part     of a pull request. How can you make the <code>build</code> job only run on the main branch?</p> Solution <pre><code>name: Unit tests &amp; build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    ...\n  build:\n    needs: test\n    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}\n    ...\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we need to add the steps to submit the build job to GCP. You need four steps:</p> <ul> <li>Checkout the code</li> <li>Authenticate with GCP</li> <li>Setup gcloud</li> <li>Submit the build</li> </ul> <p>How can you do this? Hint: For the first two steps these two GitHub actions can be useful: auth and setup-gcloud.</p> Solution <pre><code>name: Unit tests &amp; build\n\non:\n  push:\n    branches: [main]\n  pull_request:\n    branches: [main]\n\njobs:\n  test:\n    ...\n  build:\n    needs: test\n    if: ${{ github.event_name == 'push' &amp;&amp; github.ref == 'refs/heads/main' }}\n    runs-on: ubuntu-latest\n    steps:\n    - name: Checkout code\n      uses: actions/checkout@v4\n\n    - name: Auth with GCP\n      uses: google-github-actions/auth@v2\n      with:\n        credentials_json: ${{ secrets.GCLOUD_SERVICE_KEY }}\n\n    - name: Set up Cloud SDK\n      uses: google-github-actions/setup-gcloud@v2\n\n    - name: Submit build\n      run: gcloud builds submit --config cloudbuild_containers.yaml\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) The <code>cloudbuild</code> specification format allows you to specify so-called     substitutions. A substitution     is simply a way to replace a variable in the <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> file with a value that is known only at runtime. This     can be useful for using the same <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> file for multiple builds. Try to implement a substitution in your     docker cloud build file such that the image name is a variable.</p> <p>Build in substitutions</p> <p>You have probably already encountered substitutions like <code>$PROJECT_ID</code> in the <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> file. These are substitutions that are automatically replaced by GCP. Other commonly used are <code>$BUILD_ID</code>, <code>$PROJECT_NUMBER</code> and <code>$LOCATION</code>. You can find a full list of built.in substitutions here</p> Solution <p>We just need to add the <code>substitutions</code> field to the <code>cloudbuild.yaml</code> file. For example, if we want to replace the image name with a variable called <code>_IMAGE_NAME</code> we can do the following:</p> <pre><code>steps:\n- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'\n  id: 'Build container image'\n  args: [\n    'build',\n    '.',\n    '-t',\n    'europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/&lt;registry-name&gt;/$_IMAGE_NAME',\n    '-f',\n    '&lt;path-to-dockerfile&gt;'\n  ]\n- name: 'gcr.io/cloud-builders/docker'\n  id: 'Push container image'\n  args: [\n    'push',\n    'europe-west1-docker.pkg.dev/$PROJECT_ID/&lt;registry-name&gt;/$_IMAGE_NAME'\n  ]\nsubstitutions:\n  _IMAGE_NAME: 'my_image'\n</code></pre> <p>Do note that user substitutions are prefixed with an underscore <code>_</code> to distinguish them from built-in. You can read more here</p> <ol> <li> <p>How would you provide the value for the <code>_IMAGE_NAME</code> variable to the <code>gcloud builds submit</code> command?</p> Solution <p>You can provide the value for the <code>_IMAGE_NAME</code> variable by adding the <code>--substitutions</code> flag to the <code>gcloud builds submit</code> command:</p> <pre><code>gcloud builds submit --config=cloudbuild.yaml --substitutions=_IMAGE_NAME=my_image\n</code></pre> <p>If you want to provide more than one substitution you can do so by separating them with a comma.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"s6_the_cloud/using_the_cloud/#training","title":"Training","text":"<p>As the final step in our journey through different GCP services in this module, we are going to look at the training of our models. This is one of the important tasks that GCP can help us with because we can always rent more hardware as long as we have credits, meaning that we can both scale horizontally (run more experiments) and vertically (run longer experiments).</p> <p>We are going to check out two ways of running our experiments. First, we are going to return to the Compute Engine service because it gives the most simple form of scaling of experiments. That is: we create a VM with an appropriate docker image, start it, log into the VM and run our experiments. Most people can run a couple of experiments in parallel this way. However, what if there was an abstract layer that automatically created VM for us, launched our experiments and then closed the VM afterwards?</p> <p>This is where Vertex AI service comes into play. This is a dedicated service for handling ML models in GCP in the cloud. Vertex AI is in principal and end-to-end service that can take care of everything machine learning related in the cloud.

If you want to start a VM that has PyTorch pre-installed with only CPU     support you can run the following command</p> <pre><code>gcloud compute instances create &lt;instance-name&gt; \\\n    --zone europe-west1-b \\\n    --image-family=pytorch-latest-cpu \\\n    --image-project=deeplearning-platform-release\n</code></pre> <p>alternatively, if you have access to GPU in your GCP account you could start a VM in the following way</p> <pre><code>gcloud compute instances create &lt;instance-name&gt; \\\n    --zone europe-west4-a \\\n    --image-family=pytorch-latest-gpu \\\n    --image-project=deeplearning-platform-release \\\n    --accelerator=\"type=nvidia-tesla-v100,count=1\" \\\n    --metadata=\"install-nvidia-driver=True\" \\\n    --maintenance-policy TERMINATE\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Next login into your newly created VM. You can either open an <code>ssh</code> terminal in the cloud console or run the     following command</p> <pre><code>gcloud beta compute ssh &lt;instance-name&gt;\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>It is recommended to always check that the VM we get is actually what we asked for. In this case, the VM should     have PyTorch pre-installed so let's check for that by running</p> <pre><code>python -c \"import torch; print(torch.__version__)\"\n</code></pre> <p>Additionally, if you have a VM with GPU support also try running the <code>nvidia-smi</code> command.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you have logged in to the VM, it works as your machine. Therefore to run some training code you would     need to do the same setup step you have done on your machine: clone your GitHub, install dependencies,     download data, and run code. Try doing this to make sure you can train a model.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>The above exercises should hopefully have convinced you that it can be hard to scale experiments using the Compute     Engine service. The reason is that you need to manually start, setup and stop a separate VM for each experiment.     Instead, let's try to use the Vertex AI service to train our models.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by enabling it by searching for <code>Vertex AI</code> in the cloud console by going to the service or by running the     following command:</p> <pre><code>gcloud services enable aiplatform.googleapis.com\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The way we are going to use Vertex AI is to create custom jobs because we have already developed docker     containers that contain everything to run our code. Thus the only command that we need to use is     <code>gcloud ai custom-jobs create</code> command. An example here would be:</p> <pre><code>gcloud ai custom-jobs create \\\n    --region=europe-west1 \\\n    --display-name=test-run \\\n    --config=config.yaml \\\n    # these are the arguments that are passed to the container, only needed if you want to change defaults\n    --command 'python src/my_project/train.py' \\\n    --args '[\"--epochs\", \"10\"]'\n</code></pre> <p>Essentially, this command combines everything into one command: it first creates a VM with the specs specified by a configuration file, then loads a container specified again in the configuration file and finally it runs everything. An example of a config file could be:</p> CPUGPU <pre><code># config_cpu.yaml\nworkerPoolSpecs:\n    machineSpec:\n        machineType: n1-highmem-2\n    replicaCount: 1\n    containerSpec:\n        imageUri: gcr.io/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;docker-img&gt;\n</code></pre> <pre><code># config_gpu.yaml\nworkerPoolSpecs:\n    machineSpec:\n        machineType: n1-standard-8\n        acceleratorType: NVIDIA_TESLA_T4 #(1)!\n        acceleratorCount: 1\n    replicaCount: 1\n    containerSpec:\n        imageUri: gcr.io/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;docker-img&gt;\n</code></pre> <ol> <li>In this case we are requesting a Nvidia Tesla T4 GPU. This will only work if you have a quota for     allocating this type of GPU in the Vertex AI service. You can check how to request quota in the last     exercise of the previous module. Remember that it is not enough to just request a     quota for the GPU, the request needs to be approved by Google before you can use it.</li> </ol> <p>you can read more about the configuration formatting here and the different types of machines here. Try to execute a job using the <code>gcloud ai custom-jobs create</code> command. For additional documentation you can look at the documentation on the command and this page and this page</p> </li> <li> <p>Assuming you manage to launch a job, you should see an output like this:</p> <p> </p> <p>Try executing the commands that are outputted to look at both the status and the progress of your job.</p> </li> <li> <p>In addition, you can also visit the <code>Custom Jobs</code> tab in <code>training</code> part of Vertex AI</p> <p> </p> <p>You will need to select the specific region that you submitted your job to see the job.</p> </li> <li> <p>During custom training, we do not necessarily need to use <code>dvc</code> for downloading our data. A more efficient way is     to use cloud storage as a     mounted file system.     This allows us to access data directly from the cloud storage without having to download it first. All our     training jobs are automatically mounted a <code>gcs</code> folder in the root directory. Try to access the data from your     training script:</p> <pre><code># loading from a bucket using mounted file system\ndata = torch.load('/gcs/&lt;my-bucket-name&gt;/data.pt')\n# writing to a bucket using mounted file system\ntorch.save(data, '/gcs/&lt;my-bucket-name&gt;/data.pt')\n</code></pre> <p>is should speed up the training process a bit.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your code may depend on environment variables for authenticating, for example with weights and bias during     training. These can also be specified in the configuration file. How would you do this?</p> Solution <p>You can specify environment variables in the configuration file by adding the <code>env</code> field to the <code>containerSpec</code> field. For example, if you want to specify the <code>WANDB_API_KEY</code> you can do it like this:</p> <pre><code>workerPoolSpecs:\n    machineSpec:\n        machineType: n1-highmem-2\n    replicaCount: 1\n    containerSpec:\n        imageUri: gcr.io/&lt;project-id&gt;/&lt;docker-img&gt;\n        env:\n        - name: WANDB_API_KEY\n          value: &lt;your-wandb-api-key&gt;\n</code></pre> <p>You need to replace <code>&lt;your-wandb-api-key&gt;</code> with your actual key. Also, remember that this file now contains a secret and should be treated as such.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to execute multiple jobs with different configurations e.g. change the <code>--args</code> field in the <code>gcloud ai     custom-jobs create</code> command at the same time. This should hopefully show you how easy it is to scale experiments     using the Vertex AI service.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"s6_the_cloud/using_the_cloud/#secrets-management","title":"Secrets management","text":"<p>Similar to GitHub Actions, GCP also has a secrets store that can be used to keep secrets safe.

First, there is the <code>availableSecrets</code> field that specifies what secrets from the Secret Manager should be injected into the build. In this case, we are injecting the <code>WANDB_API_KEY</code> and setting it as an environment variable. The second part is the <code>secretEnv</code> field in the first step. This field specifies which secrets should be available in the first step. The steps are then doing:</p> <ol> <li> <p>The first step call the envsubst command which is a     general Linux command that replaces environment variables in a file. In this case, it replaces the     <code>$WANDB_API_KEY</code> with the actual value of the secret.

It is essentially a specification of the intermediary transportation method between the client and server. An HTTP request essentially consists of two parts:</p> <ul> <li>A request URL: the location of the server we want to send our request to</li> <li>A request Method: describing what action we want to perform on the server</li> </ul> <p>The common request methods are (case sensitive):</p> <ul> <li>GET: get data from the server</li> <li>POST/PUT: send data to the server</li> <li>DELETE: delete data on the server</li> </ul> <p>You can read more about the different methods here. For most machine learning applications, GET and POST are the core methods to remember. Additionally, if you want to read more about HTTP in general we highly recommend that you go over this comic strip protocol, but the TLDR is that it provides privacy, integrity and identification over the web.</p>"},{"location":"s7_deployment/apis/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>We are going to do a couple of exercises on sending requests using requests package to get familiar with the syntax.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by installing the `requests`` package</p> <pre><code>pip install requests\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Afterwards, create a small script and try to execute the code</p> <pre><code>import requests\nresponse = requests.get('https://api.github.com/this-api-should-not-exist')\nprint(response.status_code)\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see from the syntax, we are sending a request using the GET method.

Status codes are important when you have an application that is interacting with a server and wants to make sure that it does not fail, which can be done with simple <code>if</code> statements on the status codes</p> <pre><code>if response.status_code == 200:\n    print('Success!')\nelif response.status_code == 404:\n    print('Not Found.')\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Next, try to call the following</p> <pre><code>response=requests.get(\"https://api.github.com/repos/SkafteNicki/dtu_mlops\")\n</code></pre> <p>which gives back a payload. Essentially, payload refers to any additional data that is sent from the client to the server or vice-versa. Try looking at the <code>response.content</code> attribute. What is the type of this attribute?</p> </li> <li> <p>You should hopefully observe that the <code>.content</code> attribute is of type <code>bytes</code>. It is important to note that this is     the standard way of sending payloads to encode them into <code>byte</code> objects. To get a more human-readable version of     the response, we can convert it to JSON format</p> <pre><code>response.json()\n</code></pre> <p>Important to remember that a JSON object in Python is just a nested dictionary if you ever want to iterate over the object in some way.</p> </li> <li> <p>When we use the GET method we can additionally provide a <code>params</code> argument, that specifies what we want the server     to send back for a specific request URL:</p> <pre><code>response = requests.get(\n    'https://api.github.com/search/repositories',\n    params={'q': 'requests+language:python'},\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Before looking at <code>response.json()</code> can you explain what the code does? You can try looking at this page for help.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sometimes the content of a page cannot be converted into JSON, because as already stated data is sent as bytes.

Next, try calling <code>response.content</code>. To get the result in this case we would need to convert from bytes to an image:</p> <pre><code>with open(r'img.png','wb') as f:\n    f.write(response.content)\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The <code>get</code> method is the most useful method because it allows us to get data from the server. However, as stated in     the beginning multiple request methods exist, for example, the POST method for sending data to the server. Try     executing:</p> <pre><code>pload = {'username':'Olivia','password':'123'}\nresponse = requests.post('https://httpbin.org/post', data = pload)\n</code></pre> <p>Investigate the response (this is an artificial example because we do not control the server).</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, we should also know that requests can be sent directly from the command line using the <code>curl</code> command.     Sometimes it is easier to send a request directly from the terminal and sometimes it is easier to do it from a     script.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Make sure you have <code>curl</code> installed, or else find instruction on installing it. To check call <code>curl -</code>-help` with     the documentation on curl.</p> </li> <li> <p>To execute <code>requests.get('https://api.github.com')</code> using curl we would simply do</p> <pre><code>curl -X GET \"https://api.github.com\"\ncurl -X GET -I \"https://api.github.com\" # if you want the status code\n</code></pre> <p>Try it yourself.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to redo some of the exercises yourself using <code>curl</code>.</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>That ends the intro session on <code>requests</code>.

We are now going to move on to the server side where we will be learning about writing the APIs that requests can interact with. An application programming interface (API) is essentially the way for the developer (you) tells a user how to use the application that you have created. The API is an abstraction layer that allows the user to interact with our application in the way we want them to interact with it, without the user even having to look at the code.</p> <p>We can take the API from GitHub as an example https://api.github.com. This API allows any user to retrieve, integrate and send data to GitHub without ever having to visit their webpage. The API exposes multiple endpoints that have various functions:</p> <ul> <li>https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/branches: check out the branches on a given repository</li> <li>https://api.github.com/search/code: search through GitHub for repositories</li> <li>https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/workflows: check the status of workflows for a given repository</li> </ul> <p>and we could go on. However, there may be functionality that GitHub is not interested in users having access to and they may therefore choose not to have endpoints for specific features (1).</p> <ol> <li> Many companies provide public APIs to interact with their services/data. For a general list of     public APIs you can check out this page. For the Danes out there, you     can check out this list of public and private APIs from Danish companies and     organizations.</li> </ol> <p>The particular kind of API we are going to work with is called REST API (or RESTful API). The REST API specify specific constraints that a particular API needs to fulfill to be considered RESTful. You can read more about what the six guiding principles behind REST API on this page but one of the most important to have in mind is that the client-server architecture needs to be stateless. This means that whenever a request is send to the server it needs to be self-contained (all information included) and the server cannot rely on any previously stored information from previous requests.</p> <p>To implement APIs in practice we are going to use FastAPI. FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints. FastAPI is only one of many frameworks for defining APIs, however, compared to other frameworks such as Flask and django it offers a sweet spot of being flexible enough to do what you want without having many additional (unnecessary) features.</p>"},{"location":"s7_deployment/apis/#exercises_1","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>The exercises below are a condensed version of this and this tutorial. If you ever need context for the exercises, we can recommend trying to go through these. Additionally, we also provide this solution file that you can look through for help.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Install FastAPI</p> <pre><code>pip install fastapi\n</code></pre> <p>This contains the functions, modules, and variables we are going to need to define our interface.</p> </li> <li> <p>Additionally, also install <code>uvicorn</code> which is a package for defining low level server applications.</p> <pre><code>pip install uvicorn[standard]\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Start by defining a small application like this in a file called <code>main.py</code>:</p> <pre><code>from fastapi import FastAPI\napp = FastAPI()\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n\n@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")\ndef read_item(item_id: int):\n    return {\"item_id\": item_id}\n</code></pre> <p>Importantly here is the use of the <code>@app.get</code> decorator. What could this decorator refer to? Explain what the two functions are probably doing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next lets launch our app. Since we called our script <code>main.py</code> and we inside the script initialized our API with     <code>app = FastAPI</code>, our application that we want to deploy can be referenced by <code>main:app</code>:</p> <pre><code>uvicorn --reload --port 8000 main:app\n</code></pre> <p>this will launch a server at this page: <code>http://localhost:8000/</code>. As you will hopefully see, this page will return the content of the <code>root</code> function, like the image below. Remember to also check the output in your terminal as that will give info on when and how your application is being invoked.</p> <p> </p> <ol> <li> <p>What webpage should you open to get the server to return <code>1</code>?</p> </li> <li> <p>Also checkout the pages: <code>http://localhost:8000/docs</code> and <code>http://localhost:8000/redoc</code>. What does     these pages show?</p> </li> <li> <p>The power of the <code>docs</code> and <code>redoc</code> pages is that they allow you to easily test your application with their     simple UI. As shown in the image below, simply open the endpoint you want to test, click the <code>Try it out</code>     button, input any values and execute it. It will return both the corresponding <code>curl</code> command for invoking     your endpoint, the corresponding URL and response of you application. Try it out.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>You can also checkout <code>http://localhost:8000/openapi.json</code> to check out the schema that is generated     which essentially is a <code>json</code> file containing the overall specifications of your program.</p> </li> <li> <p>Try to access <code>http://localhost:8000/items/foo</code>, what happens in this case? When you specify types in your API,     FastAPI will automatically do type validation using pydantic, making sure users     can only access your API with the correct types. Therefore, remember to include types in your applications!</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>With the fundamentals in place let's configure it a bit more:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Lets start by changing the root function to include a bit more info. In particular we are also interested in     returning the status code so the end user can easily read that. Default status codes are included in the     http built-in Python package:</p> <pre><code>from http import HTTPStatus\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef root():\n    \"\"\" Health check.\"\"\"\n    response = {\n        \"message\": HTTPStatus.OK.phrase,\n        \"status-code\": HTTPStatus.OK,\n    }\n    return response\n</code></pre> <p>try to reload the app and see what is returned now. You should not have to re-launch the app because we initialized the app with the <code>--reload</code> argument.</p> </li> <li> <p>When we decorate our functions with <code>@app.get(\"/items/{item_id}\")</code>, <code>item_id</code> is in the case what we call a     path parameters because it is a parameter that is directly included in the path of our endpoint. We have     already seen how we can restrict a path to a single type, but what if we want to restrict it to specific values?     This is often the case if we are working with parameters of type <code>str</code>. In this case we would need to define a     <code>enum</code>:</p> <pre><code>from enum import Enum\nclass ItemEnum(Enum):\n    alexnet = \"alexnet\"\n    resnet = \"resnet\"\n    lenet = \"lenet\"\n\n@app.get(\"/restric_items/{item_id}\")\ndef read_item(item_id: ItemEnum):\n    return {\"item_id\": item_id}\n</code></pre> <p>Add this API, reload and execute both a valid parameter and a non-valid parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>In contrast to path parameters we have query parameters. In the requests exercises we saw an example of this     where we were calling https://api.github.com/search/code with the query <code>'q': 'requests+language:python'</code>.     Any parameter in FastAPI that is not a path parameter, will be considered a query parameter:</p> <pre><code>@app.get(\"/query_items\")\ndef read_item(item_id: int):\n    return {\"item_id\": item_id}\n</code></pre> <p>Add this API, reload and figure out how to pass in a query parameter.</p> </li> <li> <p>We have until now worked with the <code>.get</code> method, but lets also see an example of the <code>.post</code> method. As already     described the POST request method is used for uploading data to the server. Here is a simple app that saves     username and password in a database (please never implement this in real life like this):</p> <pre><code>database = {'username': [ ], 'password': [ ]}\n\n@app.post(\"/login/\")\ndef login(username: str, password: str):\n    username_db = database['username']\n    password_db = database['password']\n    if username not in username_db and password not in password_db:\n        with open('database.csv', \"a\") as file:\n            file.write(f\"{username}, {password} \\n\")\n        username_db.append(username)\n        password_db.append(password)\n    return \"login saved\"\n</code></pre> <p>Make sure you understand what the function does and then try to execute it a couple of times to see your database updating. It is important to note that we sometimes in the following exercises use the <code>.get</code> method and sometimes the <code>.post</code> method. For our usage it does not really matter.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>We are now moving on to figuring out how to provide different standard inputs like text, images, json to our APIs. It     is important that you try out each example yourself and in particular you look at the <code>curl</code> commands that are     necessary to invoke each application.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Here is a small application, that takes a single text input</p> <pre><code>@app.get(\"/text_model/\")\ndef contains_email(data: str):\n    regex = r'\\b[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\\.[A-Z|a-z]{2,}\\b'\n    response = {\n        \"input\": data,\n        \"message\": HTTPStatus.OK.phrase,\n        \"status-code\": HTTPStatus.OK,\n        \"is_email\": re.fullmatch(regex, data) is not None\n    }\n    return response\n</code></pre> <p>What does the application do? Try it out yourself</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's say we wanted to extend the application to check for a specific email domain, either <code>gmail</code> or <code>hotmail</code>.     Assume that we want to feed this into our application as a <code>json</code> object e.g.</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"email\": \"mlops@gmail.com\",\n    \"domain_match\": \"gmail\"\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Figure out how to alter the <code>data</code> parameter such that it takes in the <code>json</code> object and make sure to extend the application to check if the email and domain also match. Hint: take a look at this page</p> </li> <li> <p>Let's move on to an application that requires a file input:</p> <pre><code>from fastapi import UploadFile, File\nfrom typing import Optional\n\n@app.post(\"/cv_model/\")\nasync def cv_model(data: UploadFile = File(...)):\n    with open('image.jpg', 'wb') as image:\n        content = await data.read()\n        image.write(content)\n        image.close()\n\n    response = {\n        \"input\": data,\n        \"message\": HTTPStatus.OK.phrase,\n        \"status-code\": HTTPStatus.OK,\n    }\n    return response\n</code></pre> <p>A couple of new things are going on here: we use the specialized <code>UploadFile</code> and <code>File</code> bodies in our input definition. Additionally, we added the <code>async</code>/<code>await</code> keywords. Figure out what everything does and try to run the application (you can use any image file you like).</p> </li> <li> <p>The above application actually does not do anything. Let's add opencv     as a package and let's resize the image. It can be done with the following three lines:</p> <pre><code>import cv2\nimg = cv2.imread(\"image.jpg\")\nres = cv2.resize(img, (h, w))\n</code></pre> <p>Figure out where to add them in the application and additionally add <code>h</code> and <code>w</code> as optional parameters, with a default value of 28. Try running the application where you specify everything and one more time where you leave out <code>h</code> and <code>w</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Finally, let's also figure out how to return a file from our application. You will need to add the following     lines:</p> <pre><code>from fastapi.responses import FileResponse\ncv2.imwrite('image_resize.jpg', res)\nFileResponse('image_resize.jpg')\n</code></pre> <p>Figure out where to add them to the code and try running the application one more time to see that you get a file back with the resized image.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>A common pattern in most applications is that we want some code to run on startup and some code to run on shutdown.     FastAPI allows us to do this by controlling the lifespan of our application. This is done by implementing the     <code>lifespan</code> function. Look at the documentation for lifespan events     and implement a small application that prints <code>Hello</code> on startup and <code>Goodbye</code> on shutdown.</p> Solution <p>Here is a simple example that will print <code>Hello</code> on startup and <code>Goodbye</code> on shutdown.</p> <pre><code>from contextlib import asynccontextmanager\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\n@asynccontextmanager\nasync def lifespan(app: FastAPI):\n    print(\"Hello\")\n    yield\n    print(\"Goodbye\")\n\napp = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)\n\n@app.get(\"/\")\ndef read_root():\n    return {\"Hello\": \"World\"}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Let's try to figure out how to use FastAPI in a Machine learning context. Below is a script that downloads     a <code>VisionEncoderDecoder</code> from     huggingface     . The model can be used to create captions for a given image. Thus calling</p> <pre><code>predict_step(['s7_deployment/exercise_files/my_cat.jpg'])\n</code></pre> <p>returns a list of strings like <code>['a cat laying on a couch with a stuffed animal']</code> (try this yourself). Create a FastAPI application that can do inference using this model e.g. it should take in an image, preferably some optional hyperparameters (like <code>max_length</code>) and should return a string (or list of strings) containing the generated caption.</p> <p>simple ML application</p> <pre><code>from transformers import VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\nfrom PIL import Image\n\nmodel = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained(\"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning\")\nfeature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning\")\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning\")\n\ndevice = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\nmodel.to(device)\n\ngen_kwargs = {\"max_length\": 16, \"num_beams\": 8, \"num_return_sequences\": 1}\ndef predict_step(image_paths):\n    images = []\n    for image_path in image_paths:\n        i_image = Image.open(image_path)\n        if i_image.mode != \"RGB\":\n            i_image = i_image.convert(mode=\"RGB\")\n\n        images.append(i_image)\n    pixel_values = feature_extractor(images=images, return_tensors=\"pt\").pixel_values\n    pixel_values = pixel_values.to(device)\n    output_ids = model.generate(pixel_values, **gen_kwargs)\n    preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n    preds = [pred.strip() for pred in preds]\n    return preds\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    print(predict_step(['s7_deployment/exercise_files/my_cat.jpg']))\n</code></pre> Solution ml_app.py<pre><code>from contextlib import asynccontextmanager\n\nimport torch\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI, File, UploadFile\nfrom PIL import Image\nfrom transformers import AutoTokenizer, VisionEncoderDecoderModel, ViTFeatureExtractor\n\n\n@asynccontextmanager\nasync def lifespan(app: FastAPI):\n    \"\"\"Load and clean up model on startup and shutdown.\"\"\"\n    global model, feature_extractor, tokenizer, device, gen_kwargs\n    print(\"Loading model\")\n    model = VisionEncoderDecoderModel.from_pretrained(\"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning\")\n    feature_extractor = ViTFeatureExtractor.from_pretrained(\"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning\")\n    tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(\"nlpconnect/vit-gpt2-image-captioning\")\n    device = torch.device(\"cuda\" if torch.cuda.is_available() else \"cpu\")\n    model.to(device)\n    gen_kwargs = {\"max_length\": 16, \"num_beams\": 8, \"num_return_sequences\": 1}\n\n    yield\n\n    print(\"Cleaning up\")\n    del model, feature_extractor, tokenizer, device, gen_kwargs\n\n\napp = FastAPI(lifespan=lifespan)\n\n\n@app.post(\"/caption/\")\nasync def caption(data: UploadFile = File(...)):\n    \"\"\"Generate a caption for an image.\"\"\"\n    i_image = Image.open(data.file)\n    if i_image.mode != \"RGB\":\n        i_image = i_image.convert(mode=\"RGB\")\n\n    pixel_values = feature_extractor(images=[i_image], return_tensors=\"pt\").pixel_values\n    pixel_values = pixel_values.to(device)\n    output_ids = model.generate(pixel_values, **gen_kwargs)\n    preds = tokenizer.batch_decode(output_ids, skip_special_tokens=True)\n    return [pred.strip() for pred in preds]\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>As the final step, we want to figure out how to include our FastAPI application in a docker container as it will help     us when we want to deploy in the cloud because docker as always can take care of the dependencies for our     application. For the following set of exercises you can take whatever previous FastAPI application as the base     application for the container</p> <ol> <li> <p>Start by creating a <code>requirement.txt</code> file for your application. You will at least need <code>fastapi</code> and <code>uvicorn</code>     in the file and we always recommend that you are specific about the version you want to use</p> <pre><code>fastapi&gt;=0.68.0,&lt;0.69.0\nuvicorn&gt;=0.15.0,&lt;0.16.0\n# add anything else you application needs to be able to run\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Next, create a <code>Dockerfile</code> with the following content</p> <pre><code>FROM python:3.9\nWORKDIR /code\nCOPY ./requirements.txt /code/requirements.txt\n\nRUN pip install --no-cache-dir --upgrade -r /code/requirements.txt\nCOPY ./app /code/app\n\nCMD [\"uvicorn\", \"app.main:app\", \"--host\", \"0.0.0.0\", \"--port\", \"80\"]\n</code></pre> <p>The above assumes that your file structure looks like this</p> <pre><code>.\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 app\n\u2502   \u251c\u2500\u2500 __init__.py\n\u2502   \u2514\u2500\u2500 main.py\n\u251c\u2500\u2500 Dockerfile\n\u2514\u2500\u2500 requirements.txt\n</code></pre> <p>Hopefully, all these steps should look familiar if you already went through module M9, except for maybe the last line. However, this is just the standard way that we have run our FastAPI applications in the last couple of exercises, this time with some extra arguments regarding the ports we allow.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, build the corresponding docker image</p> <pre><code>docker build -t my_fastapi_app .\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Finally, run the image such that a container is spun up that runs our application. The important part here is     to remember to specify the <code>-p</code> argument (p for port) which should be the same number as the port we have     specified in the last line of our Dockerfile.</p> <pre><code>docker run --name mycontainer -p 80:80 myimage\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Check that everything is working by going to the corresponding localhost page     http://localhost/items/5?q=somequery</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>This ends the module on APIs. If you want to go further in this direction we highly recommend that you check out bentoml which is an API standard that focuses solely on creating easy-to-understand APIs and services for ml-applications.

Make sure it is a 2nd     Gen function, give it a name, set the server region to somewhere close by and change the authentication policy to     <code>Allow unauthenticated invocations</code> so we can access it directly from a browser. Remember to note down the</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>On the next page, for <code>Runtime</code> pick the <code>Python 3.11</code> option (or newer). This will make the inline editor show both     a <code>main.py</code> and <code>requirements.py</code> file. Look over them and try to understand what they do. Especially, take a     look at the functions-framework which is a     needed requirement of any Cloud function.</p> <p> </p> <p>After you have looked over the files, click the <code>Deploy</code> button.</p> Solution <p>The <code>functions-framework</code> is a lightweight, open-source framework for turning Python functions into HTTP functions. Any function that you deploy to Cloud Functions must be wrapped in the <code>@functions_framework.http</code> decorator.</p> </li> <li> <p>Afterwards, the function should begin to deploy. When it is done, you should see \u2705. Now let's test it by going to     the <code>Testing</code> tab.</p> <p> </p> </li> <li> <p>If you know what the application does, it should come as no surprise that it can run without any input. We     therefore just send an empty request by clicking the <code>Test The Function</code> button. Does the function return     the output you expected? Wait for the logs to show up. What do they show?</p> <ol> <li> <p>What should the <code>Triggering event</code> look like in the testing prompt for the program to respond with</p> <pre><code>Hallo General Kenobi!\n</code></pre> <p>Try it out.</p> Solution <p>The default triggering event is a JSON object with a key <code>name</code> and a value. Therefore the triggering event should look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"name\": \"General Kenobi\"\n}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Go to the trigger tab and go to the URL for the application. Execute the API a couple of times. How can you     change the URL to make the application respond with the same output as above?</p> Solution <p>You can change the URL to include a query parameter <code>name</code> with the value <code>General Kenobi</code>. For example</p> <pre><code>https://us-central1-my-personal-mlops-project.cloudfunctions.net/function-3?name=General%20Kanobi\n</code></pre> <p>where you would need to replace everything before the <code>?</code> with your URL.</p> </li> <li> <p>Click on the metrics tab. You should hopefully see it being populated with a few data points. Identify what each     panel is showing.</p> Solution <ul> <li>Invocations/Second: The number of times the function is invoked per second</li> <li>Execution time (ms): The time it takes for the function to execute in milliseconds</li> <li>Memory usage (MB): The memory usage of the function in MB</li> <li>Instance count (instances): The number of instances that are running the function</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Check out the logs tab. You should see that your application has already been invoked multiple times. Also, try     to execute this command in a terminal:</p> <pre><code>gcloud functions logs read\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Next, we are going to create our own application that takes some input so we can try to send it requests. We provide     a very simple script to get started.</p> <p>Simple script</p> sklearn_cloud_functions.py<pre><code># Load data\nimport pickle\n\nimport numpy as np\nfrom sklearn import datasets\nfrom sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier\n\niris_x, iris_y = datasets.load_iris(return_X_y=True)\n\n# Split iris data in train and test data\n# A random permutation, to split the data randomly\nnp.random.seed(0)\nindices = np.random.permutation(len(iris_x))\niris_x_train = iris_x[indices[:-10]]\niris_y_train = iris_y[indices[:-10]]\niris_x_test = iris_x[indices[-10:]]\niris_y_test = iris_y[indices[-10:]]\n\n# Create and fit a nearest-neighbor classifier\n\nknn = KNeighborsClassifier()\nknn.fit(iris_x_train, iris_y_train)\nknn.predict(iris_x_test)\n\n# save model\n\nwith open(\"model.pkl\", \"wb\") as file:\n    pickle.dump(knn, file)\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Figure out what the script does and run the script. This should create a file with a trained model.</p> Solution <p>The file trains a simple KNN model on the iris dataset and saves it to a file called <code>model.pkl</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next, create a storage bucket and upload the model file to the bucket. Try to do this using the <code>gsutil</code> command     and check afterward that the file is in the bucket.</p> Solution <pre><code>gsutil mb gs://&lt;bucket-name&gt;  # mb stands for make bucket\ngsutil cp &lt;file-name&gt; gs://&lt;bucket-name&gt;  # cp stands for copy\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Create a new cloud function with the same initial settings as the first one, e.g. <code>Python 3.11</code> and <code>HTTP</code>. Then     implement in the <code>main.py</code> file code that:</p> <ul> <li>Loads the model from the bucket</li> <li>Takes a request with a list of integers as input</li> <li>Returns the prediction of the model</li> </ul> <p>In addition to writing the <code>main.py</code> file, you also need to fill out the <code>requirements.txt</code> file. You need at least three packages to run the application. Remember to also change the <code>Entry point</code> to the name of your function. If your deployment fails, try to go to the <code>Logs Explorer</code> page in <code>gcp</code> which can help you identify why.</p> Solution <p>The main script should look something like this:</p> main.py<pre><code>import pickle\n\nimport functions_framework\nfrom google.cloud import storage\n\nBUCKET_NAME = \"my_sklearn_model_bucket\"\nMODEL_FILE = \"model.pkl\"\n\nclient = storage.Client()\nbucket = client.get_bucket(BUCKET_NAME)\nblob = bucket.get_blob(MODEL_FILE)\nmy_model = pickle.loads(blob.download_as_string())\n\n\n@functions_framework.http\ndef knn_classifier(request):\n    \"\"\"Simple knn classifier function for iris prediction.\"\"\"\n    request_json = request.get_json()\n    if request_json and \"input_data\" in request_json:\n        input_data = request_json[\"input_data\"]\n        input_data = [float(in_data) for in_data in input_data]\n        input_data = [input_data]\n        prediction = my_model.predict(input_data)\n        return {\"prediction\": prediction.tolist()}\n    return {\"error\": \"No input data provided.\"}\n</code></pre> <p>And, the requirement file should look like this:</p> <pre><code>functions-framework&gt;=3.7.0\ngoogle-cloud-storage&gt;=2.14.0\nscikit-learn&gt;=1.4.0\n</code></pre> <p>importantly make sure that you are using the same version of <code>scikit-learn</code> as you used when you trained the model. Else when trying to load the model you will most likely get an error.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you have successfully deployed the model, try to make predictions with it. What should the request     look like?</p> Solution <p>It depends on how exactly you have chosen to implement the <code>main.py</code>. But for the provided solution, the payload should look like this:</p> <pre><code>{\n    \"data\": [1, 2, 3, 4]\n}\n</code></pre> <p>with the corresponding <code>curl</code> command:</p> <pre><code>curl -X POST \\\n    https://your-cloud-function-url/knn_classifier \\\n    -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n    -d '{\"input_data\": [5.1, 3.5, 1.4, 0.2]}'\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Let's try to figure out how to do the above deployment using <code>gcloud</code> instead of the console UI. The relevant command     is gcloud functions deploy. For this function     to work you will need to put the <code>main.py</code> and <code>requirements.txt</code> in a separate folder. Try to execute the command     to successfully deploy the function.</p> Solution <pre><code>gcloud functions deploy &lt;func-name&gt; \\\n    --gen2 --runtime python311 --trigger-http --source &lt;folder&gt; --entry-point knn_classifier\n</code></pre> <p>where you need to replace <code>&lt;func-name&gt;</code> with the name of your function and <code>&lt;folder&gt;</code> with the path to the folder containing the <code>main.py</code> and <code>requirements.txt</code> files.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) You can finally try to redo the exercises by deploying a PyTorch application. You will essentially     need to go through the same steps as the sklearn example, including uploading a trained model to storage and     writing a cloud function that loads it and returns some output. You are free to choose whatever PyTorch model you     want.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"s7_deployment/cloud_deployment/#cloud-run","title":"Cloud Run","text":"<p>Cloud functions are great for simple deployments, that can be encapsulated in a single script with only simple requirements.

FastAPI is a great framework, but it is a general framework meaning that it was not developed with machine learning applications in mind. This means that there are features which you may consider to be missing when considering running large scale machine learning models:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Dynamic-batching: if you have a large number of requests coming in, you may want to process them in batches to     reduce the overhead of loading the model and running the inference. This is especially true if you are running your     model on a GPU, where the overhead of loading the model is significant.</p> </li> <li> <p>Async inference: FastAPi does support async requests but not no way to call the model asynchronously. This means that     if you have a large number of requests coming in, you will have to wait for the model to finish processing (because     the model is not async) before you can start processing the next request.</p> </li> <li> <p>Native GPU support: you can definitely run part of your application in FastAPI if you want to. But again it was not     build with machine learning in mind, so you will have to do some extra work to get it to work.</p> </li> </ul> <p>It should come as no surprise that multiple frameworks have therefore sprung up that better supports deployment of machine learning algorithms (just listing a few here):</p> \ud83c\udf1f Framework \ud83e\udde9 Backend Agnostic \ud83e\udde0 Model Agnostic \ud83d\udcc2 Repository \u2b50 GitHub Stars Cortex \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 8.0k BentoML \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 7.2k Ray Serve \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 34.7k Triton Inference Server \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 8.5k OpenVINO \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 7.5k Seldon-core \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 4.4k Litserve \u2705 \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 2.7k Torchserve \u274c \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 4.2k TensorFlow serve \u274c \u2705 \ud83d\udd17 Link 6.2k vLLM \u274c \u274c \ud83d\udd17 Link 32.9k <p>The first 7 frameworks are backend agnostic, meaning that they are intended to work with whatever computational backend you model is implemented in (TensorFlow, PyTorch, Jax, Sklearn etc.), whereas the last 3 are backend specific (PyTorch, TensorFlow and a custom framework). The first 9 frameworks are model agnostic, meaning that they are intended to work with whatever model you have implemented, whereas the last one is model specific in this case to LLM's. When choosing a framework to deploy your model, you should consider the following:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Ease of use. Some frameworks are easier to use and get started with than others, but may have fewer features. As     an example from the list above, <code>Litserve</code> is very easy to get started with but is a relatively new framework and     may not have all the features you need.</p> </li> <li> <p>Performance. Some frameworks are optimized for performance, but may be harder to use. As an example from the list     above, <code>vLLM</code> is a very high performance framework for serving large language models but it cannot be used for other     types of models.</p> </li> <li> <p>Community. Some frameworks have a large community, which can be helpful if you run into problems. As an example     from the list above, <code>Triton Inference Server</code> is developed by Nvidia and has a large community of users. As a good     rule of thumb, the more stars a repository has on GitHub, the larger the community.</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this module we are going to be looking at the <code>BentoML</code> framework because it strikes a good balance between ease of use and having a lot of features that can improve the performance of serving your models.

This is a great way to package a model, but it is not the only way. The core assumption we currently have made is that the computational backend is the same as the one we trained the model on. However, this does not need to be the case. As long as we can export our model and weights to a common format, we can run the model on any backend that supports this format.</p> <p>This is exactly what the Open Neural Network Exchange (ONNX) is designed to do. ONNX is a standardized format for creating and sharing machine learning models. It defines an extensible computation graph model, as well as definitions of built-in operators and standard data types. The idea behind ONNX is that a model trained with a specific framework on a specific device, let's say PyTorch on your local computer, can be exported and run with an entirely different framework and hardware easily. Learning how to export your models to ONNX is therefore a great way to increase the longevity of your models and not being locked into a specific framework for serving your models.</p> <p></p>  The ONNX format is designed to bridge the gap between development and deployment of machine learning models, by making it easy to export models between different frameworks and hardware.

This is useful when the model can accept inputs of different sizes, e.g. when the model is used in a dynamic batching scenario. In the example above we have specified that the first axis of the input tensor should be considered dynamic, meaning that the model can accept inputs of different batch sizes.

Can you figure out what method of the model is exported to ONNX?</p> Solution <p>When a PyTorch model is exported to ONNX, it is only the <code>forward</code> method of the model that is exported. This means that it is the only method we have access to when we load the model later. Therefore, make sure that the <code>forward</code> method of your model is implemented in a way that it can be used for inference.</p> </li> <li> <p>After converting a model to ONNX format we can use the ONNX Runtime to run it.

By default the ONNX Runtime will apply these optimization in online     mode, meaning that the optimizations are applied when the model is loaded. However, it is also possible to apply     the optimizations in offline mode, such that the optimized model is saved to disk. Below is an example of how     to do this.</p> <pre><code>import onnxruntime as rt\nsess_options = rt.SessionOptions()\n\n# Set graph optimization level\nsess_options.graph_optimization_level = rt.GraphOptimizationLevel.ORT_ENABLE_EXTENDED\n\n# To enable model serialization after graph optimization set this\nsess_options.optimized_model_filepath = \"optimized_model.onnx&gt;\"\n\nsession = rt.InferenceSession(\"&lt;model_path&gt;\", sess_options)\n</code></pre> <p>Try to apply the optimizations in offline mode and use <code>netron</code> to visualize both the original and optimized model side by side. Can you see any differences?</p> Solution <p>You should hopefully see that the optimized model consist of fewer nodes and edges than the original model. These nodes are often called fused nodes, because they are the result of multiple nodes being fused together. In the image below we have visualized the first part of the computational graph of a resnet18 model, before and after optimization.</p> <p> </p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>As mentioned in the introduction, ONNX is able to run on many different types of hardware and execution engine.     You can check all providers and all the available providers by running the following code</p> <pre><code>import onnxruntime\nprint(onnxruntime.get_all_providers())\nprint(onnxruntime.get_available_providers())\n</code></pre> <p>Can you figure out how to set which provide the ONNX runtime should use?</p> Solution <p>The provider that the ONNX runtime should use can be set by passing the <code>providers</code> argument to the <code>InferenceSession</code> class. A list should be provided, which prioritizes the providers in the order they are listed.</p> <pre><code>import onnxruntime as rt\nprovider_list = ['CUDAExecutionProvider', 'CPUExecutionProvider']\nort_session = rt.InferenceSession(\"&lt;path-to-model&gt;\", providers=provider_list)\n</code></pre> <p>In this case we will prefer CUDA Execution Provider over CPU Execution Provider if both are available.</p> </li> <li> <p>As you have probably realised in the exercises on docker, it can take a long time     to build the kind of containers we are working with and they can be quite large. There is a reason for this and that     is that PyTorch is a very large framework with a lot of dependencies. ONNX on the other hand is a much smaller     framework. This kind of makes sense, because PyTorch is a framework that primarily was designed for developing e.g.     training models, while ONNX is a framework that is designed for serving models. Let's try to quantify this.</p> <ol> <li> <p>Construct a dockerfile that builds a docker image with PyTorch as a dependency. The dockerfile does actually     not need to run anything. Repeat the same process for the ONNX runtime. Bonus point for developing a docker     image that takes a build arg at build time that specifies     if the image should be built with CUDA support or not.</p> Solution <p>The dockerfile for the PyTorch image could look something like this</p> inference_pytorch.dockerfile<pre><code>FROM python:3.11-slim\n\nRUN apt update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential gcc &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nARG CUDA\nENV CUDA=${CUDA}\nRUN echo \"CUDA is set to: ${CUDA}\"\n\nRUN echo \"CUDA is set to: ${CUDA}\" &amp;&amp; \\\n    if [ -n \"$CUDA\" ]; then \\\n        pip install --no-cache-dir torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu121; \\\n    else \\\n        pip install --no-cache-dir torch --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu; \\\n    fi\n</code></pre> <p>and the dockerfile for the ONNX image could look something like this</p> inference_onnx.dockerfile<pre><code>FROM python:3.11-slim\n\nRUN apt update &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt install --no-install-recommends -y build-essential gcc &amp;&amp; \\\n    apt clean &amp;&amp; rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*\n\nRUN echo \"CUDA is set to: ${CUDA}\" &amp;&amp; \\\n    if [ -n \"$CUDA\" ]; then \\\n        pip install onnxruntime-gpu; \\\n    else \\\n        pip install onnxruntime; \\\n    fi\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Build both containers and measure the time it takes to build them. How much faster is it to build the ONNX     container compared to the PyTorch container?</p> Solution <p>On unix/linux you can use the time command to measure the time it takes to build the containers. Building both images, with and without CUDA support, can be done with the following commands</p> <pre><code>time docker build . -t pytorch_inference_cuda:latest -f inference_pytorch.dockerfile \\\n    --no-cache --build-arg CUDA=true\ntime docker build . -t pytorch_inference:latest -f inference_pytorch.dockerfile \\\n    --no-cache --build-arg CUDA=\ntime docker build . -t onnx_inference_cuda:latest -f inference_onnx.dockerfile \\\n    --no-cache --build-arg CUDA=true\ntime docker build . -t onnx_inference:latest -f inference_onnx.dockerfile \\\n    --no-cache --build-arg CUDA=\n</code></pre> <p>the <code>--no-cache</code> flag is used to ensure that the build process is not cached and ensure a fair comparison. On my laptop this respectively took <code>5m1s</code>, <code>1m4s</code>, <code>0m4s</code>, <code>0m50s</code> meaning that the ONNX container was respectively 7x (with CUDA) and 1.28x (no CUDA) faster to build than the PyTorch container.</p> </li> <li> <p>Find out the size of the two docker images. It can be done in the terminal by running the <code>docker images</code>     command. How much smaller is the ONNX model compared to the PyTorch model?</p> Solution <p>As of writing the docker image containing the PyTorch framework was 5.54GB (with CUDA) and 1.25GB (no CUDA). In comparison the ONNX image was 647MB (with CUDA) and 647MB (no CUDA). This means that the ONNX image is respectively 8.5x (with CUDA) and 1.94x (no CUDA) smaller than the PyTorch image.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) Assuming you have completed the module on FastAPI try creating a small     FastAPI application that serves a model using the ONNX runtime.</p> Solution <p>Here is a simple example of how to create a FastAPI application that serves a model using the ONNX runtime.</p> onnx_fastapi.py<pre><code>import numpy as np\nimport onnxruntime\nfrom fastapi import FastAPI\n\napp = FastAPI()\n\n\n@app.get(\"/predict\")\ndef predict():\n    \"\"\"Predict using ONNX model.\"\"\"\n    # Load the ONNX model\n    model = onnxruntime.InferenceSession(\"model.onnx\")\n\n    # Prepare the input data\n    input_data = {\"input\": np.random.rand(1, 3).astype(np.float32)}\n\n    # Run the model\n    output = model.run(None, input_data)\n\n    return {\"output\": output[0].tolist()}\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> <p>This completes the exercises on the ONNX format. Do note that one limitation of the ONNX format is that is is based on ProtoBuf, which is a binary format. A protobuf file can have a maximum size of 2GB, which means that the <code>.onnx</code> format is not enough for very large models. However, through the use of external data it is possible to circumvent this limitation.</p>"},{"location":"s7_deployment/ml_deployment/#bentoml","title":"BentoML","text":"<p>BentoML cloud vs BentoML OSS</p> <p>We are only going to be looking at the open-source version of BentoML in this module.

The first is     adaptive batching. As you are hopefully aware, modern machine learning models can process multiple samples at the     same time and in doing so increases the throughput of the model. When we train a model we often set a fixed     batch size, however we cannot do that when serving the model because that would mean that we would have to wait for     the batch to be full before we can process it. Adaptive batching simply refers to the process where we specify a     maximum batch size and also a timeout. When either the batch is full or the timeout is reached, however many     samples we have collected are sent to the model for processing. This can be a very powerful feature because it     allows us to process samples as soon as they arrive, while still taking advantage of the increased throughput of     batching.</p> <p>  The overall architecture of the adaptive batching feature in BentoML. The feature is implemented on the server side and mainly consist of dispatcher that is in charge of collecting requests and sending them to the model server when either the batch is full or a timeout is reached.

Because <code>BentoML</code> is designed to be easy to use for even     users not that familiar with Docker, it introduces the concept of a <code>bentofile</code>. A <code>bentofile</code> is a file that     specifies how the container should be build. Below is an example of how a <code>bentofile</code> could look like.</p> <pre><code>service: 'service:Summarization'\nlabels:\n  owner: bentoml-team\n  project: gallery\ninclude:\n  - '*.py'\npython:\n  packages:\n    - torch\n    - transformers\n</code></pre> <p>which can then be used to build a <code>bento</code> using the following command</p> <pre><code>bentoml build\n</code></pre> <p>A <code>bento</code> is not a docker image, but it can be used to build a docker image with the following command</p> <pre><code>bentoml containerize summarization:latest\n</code></pre> <ol> <li> <p>Can you figure out how the different parts of the <code>bentofile</code> are used to build the docker image? Additionally,     can you figure out from the source repository how the <code>bentofile</code> is     used to build the docker image?</p> Solution <p>The <code>service</code> part specifies both what the container should be called and also what service it should serve e.g. the last statement in the corresponding dockerfile is <code>CMD [\"bentoml\", \"serve\", \"service:Summarization\"]</code>. The <code>labels</code> part is used to specify labels about the container, see this link for more info. The <code>include</code> part corresponds to <code>COPY</code> statements in the dockerfile and finally the <code>python</code> part is used to specify what python packages should be installed in the container which corresponds to <code>RUN pip install ...</code> in the dockerfile.</p> <p>Regarding how the <code>bentofile</code> is used to build the docker image, the <code>bentoml</code> package contains a number of templates (written using the jinja2 templating language) that are used to generate the dockerfiles. The templates can be found here.</p> </li> <li> <p>Take whatever service from the previous exercises and try to containerize it. You are free to either write a     <code>bentofile</code> or a <code>dockerfile</code> to do this.</p> Solution <p>The following <code>bentofile</code> can be used to containerize the very first service we implemented in this set of exercises.</p> <pre><code>service: 'bentoml_service:ImageClassifierService'\nlabels:\n  owner: bentoml-team\n  project: gallery\ninclude:\n- 'bentoml_service.py'\n- 'model.onnx'\npython:\n  packages:\n    - onnxruntime\n    - numpy\n</code></pre> <p>The corresponding dockerfile would look something like this</p> <pre><code>FROM python:3.11-slim\nWORKDIR /bento\nCOPY bentoml_service.py .\nCOPY model.onnx .\nRUN pip install onnxruntime numpy bentoml\nCMD [\"bentoml\", \"serve\", \"bentoml_service:ImageClassifierService\"]\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>Deploy the container to GCP Run and test that it works.</p> Solution <p>The following command can be used to deploy the container to GCP Run.

It is essentially a graph where the nodes are the operations and the edges are the data that is passed between them. The computational graph normally represents the forward pass of the model and is the reason that we can easily backpropagate through the model to train it, because the graph contains all the necessary information to calculate the gradients of the model.</p> </li> <li> <p>In your own words, explain why fusing operations together in the computational graph often leads to better     performance?</p> Solution <p>Each time we want to do a computation, the data needs to be loaded from memory into the CPU/GPU. This is a slow process and the more operations we have, the more times we need to load the data. By fusing operations together, we can reduce the number of times we need to load the data, because we can do multiple operations on the same data before we need to load new data.</p> </li> </ol> <p>This ends the module on tools specifically designed for serving machine learning models. As stated in the beginning of the module, there are a lot of different tools that can be used to serve machine learning models and the choice of tool often depends on the specific use case.

We need to add that the input for the user is     saved to a database whenever our application is called. However, to not slow down the response to our user we     want to implement this as an background task. A background task is a function that should be executed after     the user have got their response. Implement a background task that save the user input to a database implemented     as a simple <code>.csv</code> file. You can read more about background tasks     here. The header of the database should look     something like this:</p> <pre><code>time, sepal_length, sepal_width, petal_length, petal_width, prediction\n2022-12-28 17:24:34.045649, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 1\n2022-12-28 17:24:44.026432, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 1\n...\n</code></pre> <p>thus both input, timestamp and predicted value should be saved.

What does it say about your data? Have it drifted? Make sure to poke around to understand what the different plots are actually showing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Data drifting is not the only kind of reporting evidently can make. We can also get reports on the data quality.     Try first adding a few <code>Nan</code> values to your reference data. Secondly, try changing the report to</p> <pre><code>from evidently.metric_preset import DataDriftPreset, DataQualityPreset\nreport = Report(metrics=[DataDriftPreset(), DataQualityPreset()])\n</code></pre> <p>and re-run the report. Checkout the newly generated report. Again go over the generated plots and make sure that it picked up on the missing values you just added.</p> </li> <li> <p>The final report present we will look at is the <code>TargetDriftPreset</code>. Target drift means that our model is     over/under predicting certain classes e.g. or general terms the distribution of predicted values differs from     the ground true distribution of targets. Try adding the <code>TargetDriftPreset</code> to the <code>Report</code> class and re-run the     analysis and inspect the result. Have your targets drifted?</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>Evidently reports are meant for debugging, exploration and reporting of results. However, as we stated in the     beginning, what we are actually interested in methods automatically detecting when we are beginning to drift. For     this we will need to look at Test and TestSuites:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Lets start with a simple test that checks if there are any missing values in our dataset:</p> <pre><code>from evidently.test_suite import TestSuite\nfrom evidently.tests import TestNumberOfMissingValues\ndata_test = TestSuite(tests=[TestNumberOfMissingValues()])\ndata_test.run(reference_data=reference, current_data=current)\n</code></pre> <p>again we could run <code>data_test.save_html</code> to get a nice view of the results (feel free to try it out) but additionally we can also call <code>data_test.as_dict()</code> method that will give a dict with the test results. What dictionary key contains the if all tests have passed or not?</p> </li> <li> <p>Take a look at this colab notebook     that contains all tests implemented in Evidently. Pick 5 tests of your choice, where at least 1 fails by default     and implement them as a <code>TestSuite</code>. Then try changing the arguments of the test so they better fit your     usecase and get them all passing.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) When doing monitoring in practice, we are not always interested in running on all data collected from our     API maybe only the last <code>N</code> entries or maybe just from the last hour of observations. Since we are already logging     the timestamps of when our API is called we can use that for filtering. Implement a simple filter that either takes     an integer <code>n</code> and returns the last <code>n</code> entries in our database or some datetime <code>t</code> that filters away observations     earlier than this.</p> </li> <li> <p>Evidently by default only supports structured data e.g. tabular data (so does nearly every other framework). Thus,     the question then becomes how we can extend unstructured data such as images or text? The solution is to extract     structured features from the data which we then can run the analysis on.</p> <ol> <li> <p>(Optional) For images the simple solution would be to flatten the images and consider each pixel a feature,     however this does not work in practice because changes in the individual pixels does not really tell anything     about the image. Instead we should derive some feature such as:</p> <ul> <li>Average brightness</li> <li>Contrast of image</li> <li>Image sharpness</li> <li>...</li> </ul> <p>These are all numbers that can make up a feature vector for a image. Try out doing this yourself, for example by extracting such features from MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, and check if you can detect a drift between the two sets.</p> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) For text a common approach is to extra some higher level embedding such as the very classical     GLOVE embedding. Try following     this tutorial     to understand how drift detection is done on text.</p> </li> <li> <p>Lets instead take a deep learning based approach to doing this. Lets consider the     CLIP model, which is normally used to do image captioning. For our purpose     this is perfect because we can use the model to get abstract feature embeddings for both images and text:</p> <pre><code>from PIL import Image\nimport requests\n# requires transformers package: pip install transformers\nfrom transformers import CLIPProcessor, CLIPModel\n\nmodel = CLIPModel.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\nprocessor = CLIPProcessor.from_pretrained(\"openai/clip-vit-base-patch32\")\n\nurl = \"http://images.cocodataset.org/val2017/000000039769.jpg\"\nimage = Image.open(requests.get(url, stream=True).raw)\n\n# set either text=None or images=None when only the other is needed\ninputs = processor(text=[\"a photo of a cat\", \"a photo of a dog\"], images=image, return_tensors=\"pt\", padding=True)\n\nimg_features = model.get_image_features(inputs['pixel_values'])\ntext_features = model.get_text_features(inputs['input_ids'], inputs['attention_mask'])\n</code></pre> <p>Both <code>img_features</code> and <code>text_features</code> are in this case a <code>(512,)</code> abstract feature embedding, that should be able to tell us something about our data distribution. Try using this method to extract features on two different datasets like CIFAR10 and SVHN if you want to work with vision or IMDB movie review and Amazon review for text. After extracting the features try running some of the data distribution testing you just learned about.</p> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>(Optional) If we have multiple applications and want to run monitoring for each application we often want also the     monitoring to be a deployed application (that only we can access). Implement a <code>/monitoring/</code> endpoint that does     all the reporting we just went through such that you have two endpoints:</p> <pre><code>http://127.0.0.1:8000/iris_infer/?sepal_length=1.0&amp;sepal_width=1.0&amp;petal_length=1.0&amp;petal_width=1.0 # user endpoint\nhttp://127.0.0.1:8000/iris_monitoring/ # monitoring endpoint\n</code></pre> <p>Our monitoring endpoint should return a HTML page either showing an Evidently report or test suit. Try implementing this endpoint. We have implemented a solution in this file if you need help with how to return an HTML page from a FastAPI application.</p> </li> <li> <p>As an final exercise, we recommend that you try implementing this to run directly in the cloud. You will need to     implement this in a container e.g. GCP Run service because the data gathering from the endpoint should still be     implemented as an background task. For this to work you will need to change the following:</p> </li> <li> <p>Instead of saving the input to a local file you should either store it in GCP bucket or an         BigQuery SQL table (this is a better solution, but also         out-of-scope for this course)</p> </li> <li> <p>You can either run the data analysis locally by just pulling from cloud storage predictions and training data         or alternatively you can deploy this as its own endpoint that can be invoked. For the latter option we recommend         that this should require authentication.</p> </li> </ol> <p>That ends the module on detection of data drifting, data quality etc. If this has not already been made clear, monitoring of machine learning applications is an extremely hard discipline because it is not a clear cut when we should actually respond to feature beginning to drift and when it is probably fine. That comes down to the individual application what kind of rules that should be implemented. Additionally, the tools presented here are also in no way complete and are especially limited in one way: they are only considering the marginal distribution of data. Every analysis that we done have been on the distribution per feature (the marginal distribution), however as the image below show it is possible for data to have drifted to another distribution with the marginal being approximately the same.</p> <p></p> <p>There are methods such as Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) tests that are able to do testing on multivariate distributions, which you are free to dive into. In this course we will just always recommend to consider multiple features when doing decision regarding your deployed applications.</p>"},{"location":"s8_monitoring/monitoring/","title":"M28 - System Monitoring","text":""},{"location":"s8_monitoring/monitoring/#monitoring","title":"Monitoring","text":"<p>In this module we are going to look into more classical monitoring of applications.

They are often used to create dashboards that can be used to get an overview of the system. Logs Logs are textual or structured records generated by applications. They provide a detailed account of events, errors, warnings, and informational messages that occur during the operation of the system. System logs, error logs Logs are essential for diagnosing issues, debugging, and auditing. They provide a detailed history of what happened in a system, making it easier to trace the root cause of problems and track the behavior of components over time. Traces Traces are detailed records of specific transactions or events as they move through a system. A trace typically includes information about the sequence of operations, timing, and dependencies between different components.

We at least need one container actually running the application that is also exposing the <code>/metrics</code> endpoint and then we need a another container that is collecting the metrics from the first container and storing them in a database.

This was very much not the case with more traditional machine learning algorithms (random forest, support vector machines etc.) where a plateau in performance was often reached for a certain amount of data and did not improve if more was added.

As a general rule of thumb, we want the performance bottleneck to be the forward/backward e.g. the actual computation in our neural network and not the data loading. By bottleneck, we here refer to the part of our pipeline that is restricting how fast we can process data. If data loading is our bottleneck, then our compute device can sit idle while waiting for data to arrive, which is both inefficient and costly.

In <code>PyTorch</code> it is easy to parallelize data loading if you are using their dataset/data loader interface:</p> <pre><code>from torch.utils.data import Dataset, DataLoader\nclass MyDataset(Dataset):\n    def __init__(self, ...):\n        # whatever logic is needed to init the data set\n        self.data = ...\n\n    def __getitem__(self, idx):\n        # return one item\n        return self.data[idx]\n\ndataset = MyDataset()\ndataloader = Dataloader(\n    dataset,\n    batch_size=8,\n    num_workers=4  # this is the number of threads we want to parallelize workload over\n)\n</code></pre> <p>Let's take a deep dive into what happens when we request a batch from our dataloader e.g. <code>next(dataloader)</code>. First, we must understand that we have a thread that plays the role of the main and the remaining threads (in the above example we request 4) are called workers. When the dataloader is created, we create this structure and make sure that all threads have a copy of our dataset definition so each can call the <code>__getitem__</code> method.</p> <p></p> <p>Then comes the actual part where we request a batch of data. Assume that we have a batch size of 8 and we do not do any shuffling. In this step, the master thread then distributes the list of requested data points (<code>[0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7]</code>) to the four worker threads. With 8 indices and 4 workers, each worker will receive 2 indices.</p> <p></p> <p>Each worker thread then calls the <code>__getitem__</code> method for all the indices it has received. When all processes are done, the loaded images data points gets sent back to the master thread and collected into a single structure/tensor.</p> <p></p> <p>Each arrow is corresponds to a communication between two threads, which is not a free operation. In total to get a single batch (not counting the initial startup cost) in this example we need to do 8 communication operations. This may seem like a small price to pay, but that may not be the case. If the processing time of <code>__getitem__</code> is very low ( data is stored in memory, we just need to index to get it) then it does not make sense to use multiprocessing. The computational savings by doing the look-up operations in parallel are smaller than the communication cost there is between the main thread and the workers. Multiprocessing makes sense when the processing time of <code>__getitem__</code> is high (data is probably stored on the hard drive).</p> <p>It is this trade-off that we are going to investigate in the exercises.</p>"},{"location":"s9_scalable_applications/data_loading/#exercises","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>This exercise is intended to be done on the labeled faces in the wild (LFW) dataset.

We provide     the following function that for a given submodule (for example <code>model.conv1</code>) computes the amount of pruned     weights</p> <pre><code>def check_prune_level(module: nn.Module):\n    sparsity_level = 100 * float(torch.sum(module.weight == 0) / module.weight.numel())\n    print(f\"Sparsity level of module {sparsity_level}\")\n</code></pre> </li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>With a pruned network we really want to see if all our effort actually ended up with a network that is faster and/or     smaller in memory. Do the following to the globally pruned network from the previous exercises:</p> <ol> <li> <p>First we need to make the pruning of our network permanent. Right now it is only semi-permanent as we are still     keeping a copy of the original weights in memory. Make the change permanent by calling <code>prune.remove</code> on every     pruned module in the model. Hint: iterate over the <code>parameters_to_prune</code> tuple.</p> </li> <li> <p>Next try to measure the time of a single inference (repeated 100 times) for both the pruned and non-pruned network</p> <pre><code>import time\ntic = time.time()\nfor _ in range(100):\n    _ = network(torch.randn(100, 1, 28, 28))\ntoc = time.time()\nprint(toc - tic)\n</code></pre> <p>Is the pruned network actually faster? If not can you explain why?</p> </li> <li> <p>Next lets measure the size of our network (called <code>pruned_network</code>) and a freshly initialized network (called     <code>network</code>):</p> <pre><code>torch.save(pruned_network.state_dict(), 'pruned_network.pt')\ntorch.save(network.state_dict(), 'network.pt')\n</code></pre> <p>Lookup the size of each file. Are the pruned network actually smaller? If not can you explain why?</p> </li> <li> <p>Repeat the last exercise, but this time start by converting all pruned weights to sparse format first by calling     the <code>.to_sparse()</code> method on each pruned weight. Is the saved model smaller now?</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> <p>This ends the exercises on pruning. As you probably realized in the last couple of exercises, then pruning does not guarantee speedups out of the box. This is because linear operations in PyTorch does not handle sparse structures out of the box. To actually get speedups we would need to deep dive into the sparse tensor operations, which again does not even guarantee that a speedup because the performance of these operations depends on the sparsity structure of the pruned weights. Investigating this is out of scope for these exercises, but we highly recommend checking it out if you are interested in sparse networks.</p>"},{"location":"s9_scalable_applications/inference/#knowledge-distillation","title":"Knowledge distillation","text":"<p>Knowledge distillation is somewhat similar to pruning, in the sense that it tries to find a smaller model that can perform equally well as a large model, however it does so in a completely different way. Knowledge distillation is a model compression technique that builds on the work of Bucila et al. in which we try do distill/compress the knowledge of a large complex model (also called the teacher model) into a simpler model (also called the student model).</p> <p>The best known example of this is the DistilBERT model. The DistilBERT model is a smaller version of the large natural-language procession model Bert, which achieves 97% of the performance of Bert while only containing 40% of the weights and being 60% faster. You can see in the figure below how it is much smaller in size compared to other models developed at the same time.</p> <p></p>  Image credit  <p>Knowledge distillation works by assuming we have a big teacher that is already performing well that we want to compress. By running our training set through our large model we get a softmax distribution for each and every training sample. The goal of the students, is to both match the original labels of the training data but also match the softmax distribution of the teacher model. The intuition behind doing this, is that teacher model needs to be more complex to learn the complex inter-class relasionship from just (one-hot) labels. The student on the other hand gets directly feed with softmax distributions from the teacher that explicit encodes this inter-class relasionship and thus does not need the same capasity to learn the same as the teacher.</p> <p></p>  Image credit"},{"location":"s9_scalable_applications/inference/#exercises_3","title":"\u2754 Exercises","text":"<p>Lets try implementing model distillation ourself.
