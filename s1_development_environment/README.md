Today we start our journey into the world of machine learning operations (MLOps). However, before we can get started, we
need to make sure that you have a basic understanding of a couple of topics, as we will be using these
throughout the course. In particular, today is all about getting set up with a proper development environment that can
support your journey. Most of you probably already have experience with these topics, and it will be mostly repetition.

The reason we are starting here is that many students are missing very basic skills that are never taught but are just
expected to be picked up by yourself. This session will only cover the most basic skills to get you started on your
development journey. If you wish to learn more about basic computer science skills in general, we highly recommend that
you check out [The Missing Semester of Your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) course from MIT.
