This is typically called **inference**, a term borrowed from statistics. However, neural networks have a tendency to perform *too well* on the training data and aren't able to generalize to data that hasn't been seen before. This is called **overfitting** and it impairs inference performance. To test for overfitting while training, we measure the performance on data not in the training set called the **validation** set. We avoid overfitting through regularization such as dropout while monitoring the validation performance during training. In this notebook, I'll show you how to do this in PyTorch. \n","\n","As usual, let's start by loading the dataset through torchvision.

So, we need to turn off dropout during validation, testing, and whenever we're using the network to make predictions. To do this, you use `model.eval()`. This sets the model to evaluation mode where the dropout probability is 0. You can turn dropout back on by setting the model to train mode with `model.train()`. In general, the pattern for the validation loop will look like this, where you turn off gradients, set the model to evaluation mode, calculate the validation loss and metric, then set the model back to train mode.\n","\n","```python\n","# turn off gradients\n","with torch.no_grad():\n","    \n","    # set model to evaluation mode\n","    model.eval()\n","    \n","    # validation pass here\n","    for images, labels in testloader:\n","        ...\n","\n","# set model back to train mode\n","model.train()\n","```"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"5bGN3AnseuJ9"},"source":["> **Exercise:** Add dropout to your model and train it on Fashion-MNIST again.
