# Monitoring

---

In this module we are going to look into more classical monitoring of applications. The key concept we are often working
with here is called *telemetry*. Telemetry in general refer to any automatic measurement and wireless transmission of
data from our application. It could be numbers such as:

* The number of requests is our application receiving per minute/hour/day. This number is of interest because it is
    directly proportional to the running cost of application.
* The amount of time (on average) our application runs per request. The number is of interest because it most likely is
    the core contributor to the latency that our users are experience (which we want to be low).
* ...

In general there are three different kinds of telemetry we are interested in:

| Name | Description | Example | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Metrics | Metrics are quantitative measurements of the system. They are usually numbers that are aggregated over a period of time. E.g. the number of requests per minute. | The number of requests per minute. | Metrics are used to get an overview of the system. They are often used to create dashboards that can be used to get an overview of the system. |
| Logs | Logs are textual or structured records generated by applications. They provide a detailed account of events, errors, warnings, and informational messages that occur during the operation of the system. | System logs, error logs | Logs are essential for diagnosing issues, debugging, and auditing. They provide a detailed history of what happened in a system, making it easier to trace the root cause of problems and track the behavior of components over time. |
| Traces | Traces are detailed records of specific transactions or events as they move through a system. A trace typically includes information about the sequence of operations, timing, and dependencies between different components. | Distributed tracing in microservices architecture | Traces help in understanding the flow of a request or a transaction across different components. They are valuable for identifying bottlenecks, understanding latency, and troubleshooting issues related to the flow of data or control. |

We are going to focus on metrics in this module, because it is the first kind of telemetry data that most people want
to setup first.

## Attaching metrics to an application

Let's start by looking at how we can attach metrics to an application and expose them afterwards. The standard framework
for exposing metrics is called [prometheus](https://prometheus.io/). Prometheus is a time series database that is
designed to store metrics. It is also designed to be very easy to instrument applications with and it is designed to
scale to large amounts of data. The way prometheus works is that it exposes a `/metrics` endpoint that can be queried to
get the current state of the metrics. The metrics are exposed in a format called
[prometheus text format](https://prometheus.io/docs/instrumenting/exposition_formats/).

### ❔ Exercises

1. Start by installing the Prometheus python client

    ```bash
    pip install prometheus-client
    ```

    Remember to add the package to your `requirements.txt` file.

2. Before getting started on the coding part, we first need to understand the different kind of metrics that Prometheus
    allows for us to specify. Look through the [documentation](https://prometheus.io/docs/concepts/metric_types/) and
    describe the different types of metrics that Prometheus allows for.

    ??? success "Solution"

        The different types of metrics that prometheus allows for are:

        * `Counter`: A counter is a cumulative metric that represents a single monotonically increasing counter whose
            value can only increase or be reset to zero on restart.
        * `Gauge`: A gauge is a metric that represents a single numerical value that can arbitrarily go up and down.
            This is typically used for measured values like current memory usage, CPU usage, etc.
        * `Histogram`: A histogram samples observations (usually things like request durations or response sizes) and
            counts them in configurable buckets. It also provides a sum of all observed values.
        * `Summary`: Similar to a histogram, a summary samples observations (usually things like request durations and
            response sizes). While it also provides a total count of observations and a sum of all observed values, it
            calculates configurable quantiles over a sliding time window.

3. Assuming you have done the [previous module on data drifting](data_drifting.md) you should be familiar with the
    following API that uses a Bert model to classify the sentiment of a given review. The purpose of this exercise is
    to add some meaningful metrics to that API.

    ??? example "Sentiment API"

        ```python linenums="1" title="sentiment_api.py"
        --8<-- "s8_monitoring/exercise_files/sentiment_api.py"
        ```

    To begin with you need to do the following: Add a single metric of the type `Counter` that counts the number of
    errors the API has encountered. Then, secondly add a `app.mount` that exposes the metrics on the `/metrics`
    endpoint. When you have done this you should be able to see the metrics by running the application and going to the
    `/metrics` endpoint. You can look at the [documentation](https://prometheus.github.io/client_python/) for help on
    how to do this.

    ??? success "Solution"

        The important parts that implements the prometheus metrics are highlighted below:

        ```python linenums="1" hl_lines="10 50 74 135"
        --8<-- "s8_monitoring/exercise_files/sentiment_api_prometheus_simple.py"
        ```

    1. If you have done the previous exercise correctly you should be seeing something like the image below

        <figure markdown>
        ![Image](../figures/prometheus_metrics.png){ width="800" }
        </figure>

        Figure out why there are many more metrics than the single one you added and try to make the metric you defined
        increase in value by sending error requests to the API.

        ??? success "Solution"

            All metrics in prometheus belongs to a `registry`. The
            [registry](https://github.com/prometheus/client_python/blob/master/prometheus_client/registry.py) is a
            collection of metrics. If you do not specify a registry when you create a metric like this

            ```python
            MY_REGISTRY = CollectorRegistry()
            my_counter = Counter('my_counter', 'This is my counter', registry=MY_REGISTRY)
            ```

            then the metric will be added to the default registry. The default registry already contains a lot of
            metrics that are added by the `prometheus-client` package. To only see the metrics that you have added you
            need to specify your own registry like above and only expose that registry on the `/metrics` endpoint.

            ```python
            app.mount("/metrics", make_asgi_app(registry=MY_REGISTRY))
            ```

            For the second part of the question you can increase the value of the counter by sending a request to the
            API that will raise an error. In this case the API will raise an 500 error if the review is too long. After
            this you should see the counter increase in value.

    2. Next, we ask you to add a few more metrics to the API. Specifically we ask you to add the following metrics:

        * Add a `Counter` metric that counts the number of requests the API has received.
        * Add a `Histogram` metric that measures the time it takes to classify a review.
        * Add a `Summary` metric that measures the size of the reviews that are classified.

        Confirm that everything works by running the application, sending a couple of requests to the API and then
        checking the `/metrics` endpoint updates as expected.

        ??? success "Solution"

            The important parts that implements the prometheus metrics are highlighted below:

            ```python linenums="1" hl_lines="10 50-53 76 110 111 113 141"
            --8<-- "s8_monitoring/exercise_files/sentiment_api_prometheus_advance.py"
            ```

    3. Write a small dockerfile that containerizes the application. Check that you can build the container and run it.

        ??? example "Dockerfile for sentiment API"

            We here assume that you have implemented the code in a file called `sentiment_api_prometheus_advance.py`

            ```dockerfile
            --8<-- "s8_monitoring/exercise_files/sentiment_api_prometheus.dockerfile"
            ```

Hopefully from the exercise you have now seen how easy it is to add Prometheus metrics to an application. The next step
is to look at how we can collect these metrics when the application is running in the cloud.

## Cloud monitoring

Any cloud system with respect for itself will have some kind of monitoring system. GCP has a
service called [Monitoring](https://cloud.google.com/monitoring) that is designed to monitor all the different services.
By default it will monitor a lot of metrics out-of-box. However, the question is if we want to monitor more than the
default metrics. The complexity that comes with doing monitoring in the cloud is that we need more than one container.
We at least need one container actually running the application that is also exposing the `/metrics` endpoint and then
we need a another container that is collecting the metrics from the first container and storing them in a database. To
implement such system of containers that need to talk to each others we in general need to use a container orchestration
system such as [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/). This is out of scope for this course, but we can use a feature
of `Cloud Run` called `sidecar containers` to achieve the same effect. A sidecar container is a container that is
running alongside the main container and can be used to do things such as collecting metrics.

<figure markdown>
![Image](../figures/gcp_run_monitoring.png){ width="800" }
</figure>

### ❔ Exercises

1. Overall we recommend that you just become familiar with the monitoring tab for your cloud run service (see image)
    above. Try to invoke your service a couple of times and see what happens to the metrics over time.

2. Try creating a service level objective (SLO). In short a [SLO](https://sre.google/sre-book/service-level-objectives/)
    is a target for how well your application should be performing. Click the `Create SLO` button and fill it out with
    what you consider to be a good SLO for your application.

    <figure markdown>
    ![Image](../figures/gcp_run_slo.png){ width="800" }
    </figure>

3. To expose our own metrics we need to set up a sidecar container. To do this follow the instructions
    [here](https://cloud.google.com/stackdriver/docs/managed-prometheus/cloudrun-sidecar#default-configuration). We have
    created a simple example that uses FastAPI and Prometheus that you can find
    [here](https://github.com/SkafteNicki/gcp_monitoring_test). After you have correctly created the sidecar container
    you should be able to see your custom metrics in the monitoring tab.

## Alert systems

A core problem within monitoring is alert systems. The alert system is in charge of sending out alerts to relevant
people when some telemetry or metric we are tracking is not behaving as it should. Alert systems are a subjective
choice of when and how many should be send out and in general should be proportional with how important to the of the
metric/telemetry. We commonly run into what is referred to the
[goldielock problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldilocks_principle) where we want just the *right amount* of alerts
however it is more often the case that we either have

* Too many alerts, such that they become irrelevant and the really important ones are overseen, often referred to as
    alert fatigue
* Or alternatively, we have too little alerts and problems that should have triggered an alert is not dealt with when
    they happen which can have unforeseen consequences.

Therefore, setting up proper alert systems can be as challenging as setting up the systems for actually the metrics we
want to trigger alerts.

### ❔ Exercises

We are in this exercise going to look at how we can setup automatic alerting such that we get an message every time one
of our applications are not behaving as expected.

1. Go to the `Monitoring` service. Then go to `Alerting` tab.
    <figure markdown>
    ![Image](../figures/gcp_alert.png){ width="800" }
    </figure>

2. Start by setting up an notification channel. A recommend setting up with an email.

3. Next lets create a policy. Clicking the `Add Condition` should bring up a window as below. You are free to setup the
   condition as you want but the image is one way bo setup an alert that will react to the number of times an cloud
   function is invoked (actually it measures the amount of log entries from cloud functions).

    <figure markdown>
    ![Image](../figures/gcp_alert_condition.png){ width="800" }
    </figure>

4. After adding the condition, add the notification channel you created in one of the earlier steps. Remember to also
    add some documentation that should be send with the alert to better describe what the alert is actually doing.

5. When the alert is setup you need to trigger it. If you setup the condition as the image above you just need to
    invoke the cloud function many times. Here is a small code snippet that you can execute on your laptop to call a
    cloud function many time (you need to change the url and payload depending on your function):

    ```python
    import time
    import requests
    url = 'https://us-central1-dtumlops-335110.cloudfunctions.net/function-2'
    payload = {'message': 'Hello, General Kenobi'}

    for _ in range(1000):
        r = requests.get(url, params=payload)
    ```

6. Make sure that you get the alert through the notification channel you setup.
