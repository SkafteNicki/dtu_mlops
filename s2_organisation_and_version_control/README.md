Today we take our first steps into the world of MLOps. The set of modules in this session focuses on getting organized
and making sure that you are familiar with good development practices. While many of the practices you will learn about
in these modules do not seem that important when you are a single person working on a project, it becomes crucial when
working in large groups that the difference in how different people organize and write their code is minimized.
The topics in this session will focus on:

- Version control to help track and manage changes to your code and data
- Coding practices for staying organized in large projects

Some exercises in this course are very loosely stated (including the exercises today). You are expected to seek out
information before you ask for help (Google is your friend!) as you will both learn more from trying to solve the
problems yourself, and it is more realistic of how the "real world" works.

!!! tip "Learning objectives"

    The learning objectives of this session are:

    * Understand the basics of version control and can use `git` to track changes to your code
    * Knowledge of how to package Python code into a library and how to organize your code for reuse
    * Understand different coding practices and how to use them to improve the quality of your code
    * Can use `dvc` to version control data
